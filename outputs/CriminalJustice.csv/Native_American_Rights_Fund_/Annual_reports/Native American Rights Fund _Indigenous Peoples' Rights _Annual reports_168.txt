NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDFor 49 years, the Native
American Rights Fund hasbeen providing legal adviceand representation to Indiantribes, organizations and indi-viduals on the most importantfederal Indian law issues fac-ing them.  Since 1970, we haveachieved many important legalvictories for Native Americanpeople through our non-profitlegal advocacy and that recordof significant legal accomplish-ments continued in 2019.
We have represented the Little
Shell Tribe of ChippewaIndians of Montana for severaldecades in the federal recogni-tion administrative process at
the Department of the Interior to become a federallyrecognized tribe.  The Tribe simultaneously pursuedlegislative recognition from Congress with the assis-tance of counsel in Washington, D.C.  These legislativeefforts ended successfully in 2019 with the Little ShellTribe becoming the 574th federally recognized tribe, astunning victory ending a monumental struggle forjustice.
The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline to run from
Canada to the Gulf Coast would cross or come veryclose to the boundaries of many Indian reservationlands and tribal land holdings.  We are representingthe Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and the FortBelknap Indian Community of Montana in litigation tostop the pipeline based on Indian treaty, constitutional,trespass and tribal jurisdiction claims.  In 2019, the fed-eral government and energy company motions to dis-miss the case were denied.
We are representing the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in its
water rights claims in the Palouse River Adjudicationalong with federal government as trustee for the Tribe.In 2019, the Tribe and the U.S. filed claims for instreamflows in 24 reaches of the Palouse River and its tribu-taries, for nearly 200 springs claims on private and fed-eral lands, and for water for consumptive uses on twoIndian allotments in the Palouse watershed.  
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
recently re-affirmed the superiority of the senior waterrights of the Klamath Tribes of Oregon and downriverKlamath Basin tribes over other water interests in theKlamath Basin.  The Klamath Tribes were not parties to
the case but we filed several amicus curiae friend of thecourt briefs on their behalf during the course of the lit-igation brought by irrigators against the federal gov-ernment.  The Court also affirmed that the KlamathTribes’ water rights include waters in Upper KlamathLake that secure the Tribes’ treaty fishing rights.
We represent the American Indian Higher Education
Consortium (AIHEC) as amicus curiae in a casebrought against a tribal college by a former employeeof the college, alleging the he was discriminatedagainst by the college in violation of federal law.  Thetribal college, supported by AIHEC, was successful inhaving the case recently dismissed by the U. S. Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the ground that thecollege is an arm of the Confederated Salish andKootenai Tribes of Montana and the Tribes have sover-eign immunity from suit without their consent.
In Brackeen v. Bernhardt, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit affirmed the constitutionality of the1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, recognized the politicalstatus of tribes and Indians, and upheld the law that isso critical to safeguarding Indian child welfare.  TheCourt held that the U.S. Constitution allows Congressto pass laws that protect the best interests of Indianchildren.  We filed an amicus curiae brief in the case onbehalf of 325 tribal nations and 57 tribal organizations.
When the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) tried to exempt 5G wireless cellular infrastruc-ture from the tribal consultation requirements of theNational Historic Preservation Act, we filed suit alongwith co-counsel on behalf of several tribes in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit.  The Courtrecently issued an opinion largely holding that theFCC’s rulemaking was unlawful by failing to providea reasoned explanation for why it was within the pub-lic interest to exempt the deployment of 5G infrastruc-ture from review.
In closing, I want to thank all of our funders for their
support.  Without your support, these significant legalaccomplishments in 2019 would not have been possi-ble.  We can only hope that your support will continuein 2020 so that we can achieve even more legal victoriesfor Native Americans.

Executive Director’s ReportANNUAL REPORT 2019Greetings Friends.
Let us just say time goes by quickly! I am sad to say that this will be my last letter to you
as Chair of the Board of Directors at the Native American Rights Fund. My term on theBoard will come to an end in 2020. I am thankful for the time that I have spent with NARFstaff and the inspiring people who have served with me on the NARF Board.Finishing my term in 2020 feels momentous. In 2020, NARF will be celebrating fifty yearsof fighting for Indian Country. A milestone like this provides an opportunity to mindfullyrecognize the people, the effort, and the commitment that has brought NARF so muchsuccess in its first fifty years. It is an honor to hold a small place in this story and be a partof such a significant movement. 
Since NARF was founded in 1970, so much has changed. Many battles have been won.
Concepts like tribal sovereignty, government-to-government relations, and self-determi-nation have become well-established principles of Indian Law. Native voices have beenheard, and our issues are represented in the national arena in a way they never werebefore. There is a lot to celebrate.
Unfortunately, even though battles have been fought and won, many of the challenges
that existed in 1970, we are still fighting today. Still, we witness broken treaties, attemptsto limit participation in state and federal elections, and ignorance about ongoing Nativeissues. We still fear some of our fellow Americans vision of a future that does not includeNative Americans and tribes. That reality can be disheartening. 
That is exactly why NARF was created and has stood the test of time. NARF fights dis-
criminatory forces and protect the rights of tribes and tribal citizens. Fifty years of fightingfor progress does not change that mission. From what I have seen at NARF, the attorneysand staff today are fully committed to enforce the laws that protect Native Americanhuman rights, natural resources, cultures, and sovereignty. The fight will continue, andNARF shall endure.
There is a duty to our people, our cultures, and our survival. NARF heeds that duty, and
I call upon you, NARF supporters, to also respond to this call. Your donations and sup-port are absolutely necessary for this work to continue. As you read through this annualreport, please recognize that every step forward is only because of a shared commitmentto make progress happen. Even as my service on the NARF Board comes to an end, mycommitment to this movement remains strong. I look forward to the progress that we willcontinue to create together in the years to come.
Mvto. (Thank you.)

The Native American Rights Fund has a gov-
erning board composed of Native Americanleaders from across the country. Board mem-bers are chosen based on their involvementand knowledge of Indian issues and affairs, aswell as tribal affiliation, to ensure comprehen-sive geographical representation. The vision ofthe Board members is essential to NARF'seffectiveness in representing its NativeAmerican clients.

NARF’s first Board of Directors developed priorities to guide the Native American Rights Fund in its mission to
preserve and enforce the legal rights of Native Americans. Those five priorities continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources• Promote Native American human rights• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues
This report includes NARF’s recent work within each priority.IntroductionNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDThe US Constitution recognizes that Indian tribes are
independent governmental entities with inherentauthority over their members and territory. Tribal gov-ernments possess the power to regulate the internalaffairs of their members as well as activities withintheir reservations. In treaties with the United States,Indian tribes ceded millions of acres of land inexchange for the guarantee that the federal govern-ment would protect the tribes' right to self-govern-ment. Under the priority to preserve tribal existence ,
NARF empowers tribes to live according to Native tra-ditions, to enforce their treaty rights, to ensure theirindependence on reservations, and to protect theirright to self-govern (sovereignty). 
TRIBAL SOV eReIGNT y AND J uRISDICTION
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative
From the 19th into the mid-20th century, the USSupreme Court repeatedly affirmed the principle thattribes retain inherent sovereignty over their membersand territory. However, with the 1978 decision inOliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe , the Supreme Court
began chipping away at tribal sovereignty by restrict-ing tribal jurisdiction and extending state jurisdiction,which reached a crisis point in 2001. In response,NARF partnered with the National Congress ofAmerican Indians (NCAI) in 2001 to develop the TribalSovereignty Protection Initiative. The Initiative moni-tors legislation, judicial appointments, and cases relat-ed to tribal interests. 
~ Tribal Supreme Court Project
A major component of the Initiative is the TribalSupreme Court Project. Staffed by NARF and NCAI, itmonitors cases potentially headed to the US SupremeCourt as well as those accepted for review. The Projectis based on the idea that a strong and coordinatedapproach can reduce, and even reverse, the erosion oftribal sovereignty by Supreme Court Justices whoappear to lack an understanding of federal Indian lawand are unfamiliar with the practical challenges facingtribal governments. The Project also ensures that attor-neys representing Indian interests before the SupremeCourt have the support they need, including coordi-nating the filing of a limited number of strategic amicus
briefs. 
During the October 2019 term, there have been fewer
petitions for review filed in Indian law cases than wehave seen in several years. Currently, there are onlytwo Indian law petitions that are granted review. In an
unusual twist, the two cases present the same question:whether the Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservationwas disestablished. The question first reached theCourt last term in Sharp v. Murphy (17-1107). After oral
argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing,then announced that the case would be scheduled forre-argument in the October 2019 term. Argument hadnot been scheduled when, in December 2019, the Courtgranted review in McGirt v. Oklahoma (18-9526), which
presents the same reservation disestablishment ques-tion as Murphy.
~ Judicial Selection Project
Another important component of the TribalSovereignty Protection Initiative is the JudicialSelection Project. The Project’s focus is research andeducation: to educate the federal judiciary about tribalissues, to educate tribal leaders about the federal judi-ciary, and to reach out to elected officials and the publicat large about the need for federal judges who under-stand the unique legal status of Indian tribes. 
To date, the Senate has confirmed 187 Article III judges
nominated by President Trump. The rate of judicialconfirmations in this administration is outpacing theprevious three presidents. As it does in all administra-tions, the Judicial Selection Project has monitored thesenominations and produced research memoranda onboth of President Trump’s US Supreme Court nomi-nees and, as warranted, on lower court judicial nomi-nees.
Big Horn Electric Cooperative v. Alden Big Man, et al.
In 2012, Alden Big Man, an elderly member of theApsaalooke (Crow) Tribe sued the Big Horn ElectricCooperative in the Crow Civil Court pursuant to anApsaalooke tribal statute limiting heat and electricityservice disconnections during winter months forhomes where elderly and disabled individuals reside.In 2013, the tribal court dismissed the case, holdingthat it lacked jurisdiction over the case, which wasbrought against a non-member utility company. Mr.Big Man appealed the ruling to the ApsaalookeAppeals Court. In April 2017, the Apsaalooke AppealsCourt held that the trial court did have jurisdictionover Big Horn Electric and remanded the case to theCrow Civil Court. Big Horn Electric then filed a com-plaint in federal district court, asking the court to findthat tribal court remedies had been exhausted and thatthe tribal court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. NARF,
Preserve Tribal ExistenceANNUAL REPORT 2019representing the Apsaalooke Appeals Court judges
and Crow Tribal Health Board members, filed motionsto dismiss. Those motions were denied, and the federaldistrict court found that exhaustion had occurred. InNovember 2019, the parties began briefing crossmotions for summary judgment on the issue of tribaljurisdiction. Summary judgment briefing should becompleted by January 2020.
Oneida v. Village of Hobart - Amicus Support
NARF submitted an amicus brief on behalf of theNational Congress of American Indians and the IndianLand Tenure Foundation in the 7th Circuit Court ofAppeals case, Oneida v. Village of Hobart . The case arises
from the village of Hobart, Wisconsin, imposing fines
on tribal officials for failure to obtain village permits
for the Tribe’s Big Apple Festival, which took place ontribal property. The Tribe sued the village in federal
district court, seeking injunction and a declaration thatthe village could not enforce its regulations against the
tribe within its reservation. In response, the village
alleged that allotment either disestablished or dimin-ished the Oneida Reservation. While the federal dis-trict court held that the Oneida Reservation was notdisestablished, it did conclude that the reservation wasdiminished either by the vesting of fee title of allot-ments to Indians, or the subsequent conveyance ofthose allotments to non-Indians. This is a drasticdeparture from established law, which has held thatownership status of individual land parcels has nobearing on reservation boundaries. Moreover, the dis-trict court relied on a broad (and incorrect) under-
standing that Congress intended that GeneralAllotment Act would diminish reservations—a conclu-sion at odds with a long line of US Supreme Courtcases. Accordingly, not only is this case important forthe Oneida Nation, but it is crucial to maintaining legalstability and protection for more than 100 tribes thatwere similarly subjected to allotment.
FeDeRAL R eCOGNITION OF TRIBAL STAT uS
NARF represents Indian communities who have sur-
vived intact as identifiable Indian tribes but are notfederally recognized. Tribal existence does not dependon federal recognition, but recognition is necessary fora government-to-government relationship.
Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana
More than 20 years ago, in 1997, the governmentplaced the Little Shell Tribe’s federal recognition peti-tion on active review status. Since that time, the Tribehas endured several about-face decisions by variousAssistant Secretaries for Indian Affairs who found firstin favor and then against recognition of the Tribe. TheTribe simultaneously pursued legislative recognitionwith the assistance of counsel in Washington, DC.These legislative efforts ended successfully inDecember 2019 with the Little Shell Tribe becoming the574th federally recognized tribe. A stunning victoryending a monumental struggle for justice.
ANNUAL REPORT 2019During colonization, tribes’ lands diminished to a mere
2.3 percent of their original size. Currently, there areapproximately 55 million acres of Indian-controlled landin the continental United States and about 44 millionacres of Native-owned land in Alaska. An adequate landbase and control over natural resources are necessary foreconomic self-sufficiency and self-determination. Theyare vital to tribal existence. Thus, much of NARF’s workis to protect tribal natural resources . 
INDIAN LANDSKeystone XL Pipeline
The TransCanada (TC Energy) Keystone XL Pipeline isa massive oil pipeline intended to link the oil produc-ers in Canada with the refiners and export terminals onthe Gulf Coast. It stretches 1,179 miles and crosses, orcomes very close to, the boundaries of many reserva-tions and tribal land holdings, including the OcetiSacowin or Great Sioux Nation lands from before theFort Laramie Treaty of 1868. It also crosses many riversand the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water toSouth Dakota and Nebraska. Moreover, the proposedpipeline route crosses over sacred Sioux land and anundetermined number of cultural sites and burials, yetno consultation has occurred between the federal gov-ernment and the tribes affected. For these and otherreasons, President Obama had rejected the permitrequired for the Canada-US boundary crossing in 2015.
In March 2018, the Trump administration reversed
course and granted the necessary Presidential permit.A complaint was filed on behalf of the Rosebud SiouxTribe and the Fort Belknap Indian Community inAugust 2018. The President issued a second permit forthe Keystone XL Pipeline in an effort to circumventcourt rulings and injunctions preventing construction.As a result, the Tribes amended their complaint toreflect new claims, including claims for violations ofthe Fort Laramie and Lame Bull treaties.
The government and TC Energy filed motions to dis-
miss and a hearing was held in September 2019. InDecember 2019, the court denied the government's andTC Energy's motions to dismiss. All of the Tribes'claims relating to the new permit were allowed to pro-ceed, including the treaty claims, constitutional claims,trespass claims against TC Energy, and claims that TCEnergy and the Keystone XL Pipeline are subject totribal regulatory jurisdiction. The order is a major victory, and the case will continue.Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe
NARF is assisting the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribewith a litigation request to the United States. The Tribeoccupies a small, coastal reservation southwest ofSeattle, WA. A state highway crosses through the reser-vation, and its surface water drainage inundates a por-tion of the reservation. 
On behalf of the Tribe, NARF submitted a litigation
request requesting that the United States, as the Tribe's trustee, sue the Washington Department ofTransportation. 
Hualapai Tribe Fee to Trust Applications
NARF represents the Hualapai Indian Tribe of Arizonain preparing and submitting applications for the trans-fer into trust status of eight parcels of land owned infee by the Tribe. Three of the parcels have been accept-ed into trust. Decisions on the other five parcels havebeen significantly delayed. In April 2017, the ActingAssistant Secretary of Indian Affairs withdrew author-ity from BIA Regional Directors to approve off-reserva-tion, fee-to-trust applications and placed that authoritywith the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs. Theremaining applications continue and are in varyingstages of completion. 
Akiachak Native Community, et al. v. Department of
Interior, et al.In 2006, the Akiachak Native Community, the ChilkootIndian Association, the Chalkyitsik village Council,
and the Tuluksak Native Community IRA, representedby NARF, brought suit in the US District Court for DCseeking judicial review of 25 CFR Part 151 as it pertainsto federally recognized tribes in Alaska. This federalregulation governs the procedures used by Indiantribes and individuals requesting the Secretary of theInterior to acquire title to land in trust on their behalf.At the time, the regulation barred the acquisition ofland in trust in Alaska other than for the MetlakatlaIndian Community or its members.
In March 2013, the court granted Plaintiffs complete
relief on all of their claims-a major victory for Alaskatribes. The State of Alaska and the Interior Department(DOI) filed appeals to the US Court of Appeals for theDC Circuit. However, while the appeal was pending,DOI changed course. In December 2014, DOI pub-lished its final rule rescinding the “Alaska Exception.”On the State's appeal, DC Circuit ruled 2-1 in favor ofthe tribal appellees.
Protect Tribal Natural ResourcesNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDPursuant to the Court of Appeals' decision, DOI com-
pleted one trust land acquisition in Alaska in January2017 with nearly a dozen more pending. However, inJuly 2018, the Trump Administration officially with-drew the Solicitor's opinion supporting land-into-trustfor Alaska Tribes and announced the Departmentwould undertake a wholesale review of whether toreinstate the “Alaska Exception” into the Part 151 reg-ulations. Since the announcement, NARF has repre-sented clients at tribal consultations around Alaska,making clear Alaska tribes will tolerate nothing morethan full reinstatement of the trust lands program inAlaska. Written comments were filed in January 2019.The Department now is undertaking an “internalreview” period.
WATeR RIGHTS
Establishing tribal water rights, especially in arid west-
ern states, is a major NARF priority. Indian tribes areentitled under federal law to sufficient water for pres-ent and future needs, with a priority date at least asearly as the establishment of their reservations. Thesereserved water rights are superior to all water rightscreated after the tribal priority date. In most cases, thisgives tribes senior water rights in the water-short west.Unfortunately, many tribes have not used theirreserved water rights and most of these rights areunadjudicated or unquantified. The major need is todefine and quantify the amount of water to which eachtribe is entitled. 
Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians
NARF, with co-counsel, represents the Agua CalienteBand of Cahuilla Indians in a lawsuit filed in May 2013in the US District Court for the Central District ofCalifornia, asking the court to declare the Tribe's waterrights as senior in the Coachella valley, quantify these
rights, and prevent Coachella valley Water District and
Desert Water Agency from further impairing the quanti-ty and quality of water in the aquifer through the importof lesser quality water. In March 2015, the court ruledlargely in the Tribe's favor, holding that the Tribe has areserved right to water and that groundwater is a watersource available to fulfill that right. In March 2017, theNinth Circuit unanimously affirmed the lower court'sruling. The water districts' petition to the US SupremeCourt was denied, and the lower court's decision held. 
With “phase one” done, the parties addressed “phase
two” legal issues. Phase two dealt with the correctmethod for quantifying the Tribe's water share, theright to water of a certain quality, and whether the
Tribe owns the groundwater storage space under itsreservation. Settlement discussions were started andthen suspended in 2018. Briefing and discovery onphase two issues occurred in early 2019. In April 2019,the court dismissed the Phase two claims holding that,since the Tribe could not show that it presently had ashortage of water, it was not sufficiently injured toprove standing. This decision was made despite unre-futed evidence that the aquifer depth underlying thereservation had lowered substantially and the waterhad been degraded by the water districts' activities.
The Tribe has filed a motion to amend the 2013 com-
plaint, to add allegations relating to the Tribe's injuriesand the Tribe's pumping of groundwater, and to moreaccurately frame the issue of the ownership of the porespace under the reservation.
Palouse River Basin Adjudication - Nez Perce Tribe
Water RightsNARF represents the Nez Perce Tribe in its water rightsclaims in the Palouse River Basin Adjudication(PRBA). In October 2016, the Idaho Water Court issueda commencement order for the PRBA. An initial hear-ing was held in January 2017. NARF and the Tribe areworking with the United States to examine the natureand scope of the Tribe's water rights claims. In late2019, the US and the Tribe filed claims for instreamflows in 24 reaches of the Palouse River and its tribu-taries, for nearly 200 springs claims on private and fed-eral lands, and for water for consumptive uses on twoallotments in the Palouse watershed.
Klamath Basin Water Rights
Represented by NARF, the Klamath Tribes' waterrights were recognized in the federal courts in United
States v. Adair in 1983, but the courts left quantification
of the Tribal water rights to the State of Oregon'sKlamath Basin Adjudication (KBA). Following conclu-sion of the 38-year-long administrative phase of theKBA, the Tribes were able to enforce their water rightsfor the first time during the 2013 irrigation season. TheOregon Water Resources Department's (OWRD's)Findings of Fact and Order of Determination (FFOD)issued in the KBA are now under review in theKlamath County Circuit Court. The court adopted aphased approach for the review.
In 2017 and 2018, the Klamath County Circuit Court
resolved jurisdictional and other legal issues as well asgeneral procedural issues. Importantly, the court
PROTECT TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCESANNUAL REPORT 2019issued rulings limiting discovery and the introduction
of new evidence, preventing a complete do-over of theadministrative proceedings. However, the court ruledthat a de novo standard of review would apply, in
which the court will “look anew” at the determinationsof OWRD in the FFOD and may give deference toOWRD's determinations. 
Now the KBA is in Phase 3, which addresses the sub-
stantive exceptions filed to the individual water rightclaim determinations in the FFOD. The first of threeclaim groups were resolved in September 2019. Thesecond claim group was argued in November 2019.Opening motions for the third claim group (tribalclaims) were filed in December 2019.
Related case Baley v. US : After sixteen years of litiga-
tion, the Court of Federal Claims resoundingly re-affirmed the superiority of the senior water rights ofthe Klamath Tribes and downriver Klamath Basintribes over other water interests in the Klamath Basin.The Tribes were not parties to the case, but NARF filedseveral amicus briefs on their behalf. In December 2017,
the irrigators appealed to the US Court of Appeals forthe Federal Circuit. Briefing was in 2018. In November2019, the appeals court declared, once again, that theKlamath Tribes' water rights are the most senior in theregion. The court also affirmed that the Klamath Tribes'water rights include waters in Upper Klamath Lakethat secure the Tribes' treaty fishing rights.
Tule River Tribe
After almost 30 years of advocacy, the Tule RiverIndian Tribe, represented by NARF, successfully set-tled its water rights in November 2007. The settlementagreement secured a domestic, municipal, industrial,and commercial water supply for the Tribe. The Tribenow seeks federal legislation to ratify the agreementand authorize appropriations to develop the waterrights through the creation of water infrastructure andreservoirs on the Tule River Reservation. 
The Tribe's team assisted the federal team in develop-
ing an appraisal of several alternatives. The federalteam promised to be done with the study byNovember 2015 so that the Tribe could proceed tonegotiate an appropriate settlement to present toCongress. In December 2016 the federal team deliveredits report to the Tribe. The Tribe and its team per-formed a detailed analysis and critique of the reportand met with Interior Department officials in March2018 to brief them and bring them up to speed onnegotiation developments. In spring of 2019, the
Interior Department committed to some funding, butnot enough to construct a meaningfully sized waterstorage project on the reservation. Legislative effortscontinue. 
Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas
At times in recent decades, the water supply for theKickapoo Reservation has violated the Safe DrinkingWater Act of 1974. Consequently, the Kickapoo peoplefear they are unable to safely drink, bathe, or cook withtap water. There also is not enough water on the reser-vation to provide basic municipal services to the com-munity-the Tribe is not able to provide local schoolswith reliable, safe running water, and the fire depart-ment cannot provide adequate protection. In June2006, the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas, represented byNARF, filed a federal court lawsuit to enforce expresspromises made to the Tribe to build a reservoir project,the most cost-effective way to improve the water sup-ply. Although the Nemaha Brown Watershed JointBoard #7, the Natural Resources Conservation Serviceof the US Department of Agriculture, and the State ofKansas made promises to the Tribe over two decadesago, they continued to actively develop the region'swater resources. The result was the near depletion ofthe Tribe's senior federal water rights. The federal gov-ernment, the state, and the local watershed district allconcede the existence of the Tribe's senior Indian
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDreserved water rights; the real issue is the amount of
water needed to satisfy the Tribe's rights and thesource of that water. 
In September 2016, the Tribe and the state executed a
settlement agreement that includes a negotiated waterright for the Tribe, as well as all of the details for theadministration of the Tribe's right in the DelawareRiver watershed. The Tribe and NARF developed leg-islation in consultation with the Kansas congressionaldelegation to approve the water right negotiated withthe state. Bills were introduced and considered duringthe 115th Congress, but were not enacted into law. InJune 2019 the Kansas congressional delegation intro-duced new bills, to begin anew the legislative approvalprocess for the water settlement.
Pauma Band of Luiseno Indians
The Pauma Band of Luiseno Indians is one of the fivetribes party to the San Luis Rey Water RightsSettlement. The San Luis Rey tribes' water rights wereinitially addressed by a Congressionally-approved set-tlement act in 1988. However, for a wide variety of rea-sons, the settlement was unenforceable and did notaddress the needs of the tribes. In 2016, a bill amendingthe original settlement act was passed by Congress,and the San Luis Rey Water Rights Settlement is nowin its implementation stage. NARF represents thePauma Band in the implementation, which includesallocating water and funding as well as examininggroundwater management strategies. 
HuNTING AND FISHING RIGHTS 
Tribal rights to hunt and fish are grounded in tribal
sovereignty and affirmed in many treaties and agree-ments. As with water, the overall demand for gameand fish today often exceeds the supply. In contrast,subsistence is the sustainable Native philosophy oftaking only what you need. NARF has defended tribalhunting, fishing, and subsistence rights in a variety ofcases, most recently focused in Alaska. There often areno roads or stores in rural Alaska, and so no othergroup of people in the United States continues to be asintimately connected to the land and water and asdependent upon its vast natural resources as Alaska'sindigenous peoples.
Organized Village of Saxman IRA Council Rural
Determination StatusThe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act(ANILCA) of 1980 provides a subsistence harvest priority to Alaska's rural residents. However, it does
not define who qualifies as rural. Saxman village is acoastal community of approximately 400 residents,most of whom are Alaska Native. In 2007, the FederalSubsistence Board (FSB) promulgated a final rule thatrevoked Saxman's rural community status. The FSBreasoned that Saxman's close proximity to the town ofKetchikan-they are connected by a two-mile long road-justified aggregating the two communities as one non-rural community. NARF assisted the tribe as it soughtto reinstate its rural status. 
In May 2015, legislation to reinstate Saxman as a rural
community was introduced and soon thereafter theFSB adopted the proposed administrative rule favor-ing Saxman's rural status. NARF continues to workwith the Tribe on issues surrounding the FSB and federal subsistence management program, includingfuture policy issues surrounding rural communitystatus. 
Bering Sea Elders Group
The Bering Sea Elders Group (BSEG) is an alliance ofthirty-nine Yup'ik and Inupiaq villages that seeks toprotect the sensitive ecosystem of the Bering Sea, aswell as the subsistence lifestyle and the communitiesthat depend on it. NARF has designed a comprehen-sive plan to help this group of Alaska Native villagesin their efforts to protect the area and become moreengaged in its management. 
In December 2016, NARF's work with BSEG resulted in
President Barack Obama signing an historic ExecutiveOrder creating the Northern Bering Sea ClimateResilience Area. However, in April 2017, PresidentTrump signed an executive order called“Implementing an America-First Offshore EnergyStrategy.” While the order was aimed at re-openingArctic and Atlantic areas for offshore drilling, it alsoentirely revoked Executive Order 13754. This reversaloccurred without notice and despite all indicationsthat the suite of northern Bering Sea protections-including the focus on the role of Tribes in future deci-sions-were not in danger. BSEG responded immediate-ly in the media, determined to restore the importantconservation, economic, and cultural provisions. BSEGElders passed a resolution calling for the reinstatementof the Executive Order and its protections. BSEG andallies are working with federal representatives torestore the provisions and related legislation was intro-duced in April 2019.
PROTECT TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCESANNUAL REPORT 2019Finally, NARF is working with BSEG in its ongoing
negotiations with the bottom trawl industry. Thesenegotiations resulted in the creation of a workinggroup, which is a co-management body with equalrepresentation between the bottom trawl industry andNative villages that are close to the industry's primaryfishing grounds.
Pebble Mine
Alaska's Bristol Bay region is home to the largest wildsalmon runs in the world. It is also home to the Yup'ik,Dena'ina, and Alutiiq peoples who depend on sustain-able salmon runs for their subsistence. In 2013, NARFhelped create the United Tribes of Bristol Bay (UTBB),a consortium of tribes in the region. UTBB was formedfor tribes to directly address regional large-scale min-ing proposals threatening salmon-rearing streams.Exercising its delegated governmental authority, withNARF as counsel, UTBB has engaged the federal gov-ernment in direct government-to-government consul-tation on large scale mining in Bristol Bay like the pro-posed Pebble Mine. The proposed Pebble Mine would sit on the headwa-
ters of the largest salmon-producing river in BristolBay. In February 2014, EPA gave notice that it wouldinitiate a Clean Water Act 404(c) process for the pro-posed mine. Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibitor restrict the discharge of material in waters when itdetermines that such disposal would have an unac-ceptable adverse impact on various resources, includ-ing fisheries, wildlife, municipal water supplies, orrecreational areas. As soon as the EPA announced thatit would study the Pebble Mine, the State of Alaskarequested a stay to allow the developer to submit a per-mit under the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) process. EPA granted the state and the Corp ofEngineers an extension to respond to the notification of404(c) process. The stay ended in April 2013, and PebbleLimited Partnership (PLP) filed suit in May challengingthe EPA's review process. The district court and the USCourt of Appeals both dismissed the case.
So, in September 2014, PLP filed another complaint
against EPA. The court granted the preliminary injunc-tion, thereby halting EPA's work on the 404(c) process
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDin Bristol Bay. As the case continued, the judge issued
a broad order quashing PLP's subpoenas, finding thatthey pushed federal discovery rules to their very lim-its. After the order, PLP withdrew its remaining sub-poenas, but PLP began serving narrower subpoenas,which also were quashed. In the last days of 2016, theparties requested a stay of the proceedings in order tonegotiate a settlement of the case. 
In May 2017, the parties reached a total settlement of
the litigation. Key terms of the settlement include: (1)dismissing all Pebble's pending lawsuits against the
EPA; (2) EPA's agreeing to propose to withdraw theproposed Section 404(c) determination; (3) EPA'sagreeing it will not move to finalize any Section 404(c)action until 48 months from the date of the settlementor until the US Army Corps of Engineers issues its finalenvironmental impact statement, whichever comesfirst. PLP filed its federal permit application inDecember 2017, thereby beginning the NEPA reviewprocess. NARF and UTBB continue to work to protectBristol Bay throughout the federal and state permittingprocess surrounding the Pebble Mine.
In June 2019, Gov. Dunleavy briefly met with President
Trump on Air Force One; subsequently, he toldreporters that he was convinced that the president was“doing everything he can to work with us on our min-ing concerns.” One day after the meeting, according toCNN, the EPA held an internal meeting and informedstaff that they were reversing course and removingprotections for the Bristol Bay. In July 2019, the TrumpAdministration announced it would formally with-draw the proposed 404(c) determination from theBristol Bay watershed. 
The action was undertaken with no public input, no
tribal consultation, and no prior notice to Bristol Bay'stribes. In response to this illegal act, local interestsformed the Bristol Bay Defense Alliance, consisting ofNARF's client the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, BristolBay Native Association, Bristol Bay Regional SeafoodDevelopment Association, Bristol Bay ReserveAssociation and Bristol Bay Economic DevelopmentCorporation. The Alliance is taking legal action onbehalf of the local people who rely on the Bristol Bayfishery and all it sustains. The suit is based on the factthat the agency changed its position without good rea-son or explanation, which are required by law. NARFand its partners filed the suit in October 2019. 
Ch'u'itnu Traditional Cultural Landscape 
NARF represented the Native village of Tyonek (N vT)
in response to a permit proposal by PacRim to minecoal from the Beluga coal fields in the Cook Inlet. N vT
focused on the National Historic Protection Act(NHPA) to identify historic properties eligible for list-ing and protections. In March 2017, PacRim Coalannounced its decision to suspend pursuit of permit-ting efforts on the Chuitna Coal Project. Regardless ofthe closed permitting process, N vT nominated the
entire Ch'u'itnu watershed for inclusion on theNational Register of Historic Places as a Traditional
PROTECT TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCESANNUAL REPORT 2019Cultural Landscape (TCL). The designation would rec-
ognize the profound importance the Ch'u'itnu water-shed has played in shaping and sustaining N vT's peo-
ples' culture, traditions, identity, and subsistence.
In April 2018, the Alaska Historical Commission voted
6-2 that the Ch'u'itnu Historic District, TraditionalCultural Property was eligible for listing on theNational Register. The State Historic PreservationOfficer rejected the recommendation, but sent the nom-ination to the Keeper of the National Register for finaldetermination. In June 2018, the Keeper requestedadditional documentation. A revised nomination wasreturned to the Keeper in June 2019. In August 2019,the Keeper requested more documentation. N vT and
NARF continue their efforts to get the Ch'u'itnu TCLbefore the Keeper for a final determination.
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain ishome to the calving grounds of the Porcupine CaribouHerd-one of the largest wild herds in the world-and ofgreat cultural importance to the Gwich'in Tribes ofAlaska, who refer to the area as Iizhik Gwats'anGwandaii Goodlit (the sacred place where life begins).Since 1980, when the Coastal Plain was first consid-ered for development, the Gwich'in Tribes haveworked tirelessly to protect the Refuge and the cari-bou. NARF represents the Native village of venetie
Tribal Government, venetie village Council, and Artic
village Council, three federally recognized Gwich'in
tribes, and advises them on their rights and strategicoptions surrounding proposed development of theCoastal Plain.
In 2017, Congress enacted tax reform legislation that
contained a provision opening the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain to oil and gas develop-ment. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) beganthe environmental review process to open the CoastalPlain to oil and gas leasing. 
In December 2018, the BLM published its draft envi-
ronmental impact statement (EIS). Despite months ofgovernment-to-government meetings, the draft EISwas based on pre-existing data and research fromother regions in Alaska that brushed aside the effectson subsistence and cultural resources. The final EIS,released in September 2019, identified the most devel-opment-intensive alternative as the preferred option.The BLM's preferred alternative offers the entireCoastal Plain for leasing and includes the least protec-tions for natural, cultural, and subsistence resources.
The BLM has yet to publish a record of decision, final-izing the agency's plans.
eNVIRONM eNTAL PROT eCTION 
NCAI Climate Change Matters
The effects of climate change on indigenous peoplesthroughout the world are acute and will only getworse. NARF represents the National Congress ofAmerican Indians (NCAI) on climate change mattersat the international level through the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFC-CC). NARF and NCAI are ensuring that indigenousrights are protected in any international treaty oragreement governing greenhouse gas emissionsreductions.
In December 2015, the Paris Agreement, the first 
universally binding accord on climate change, wasadopted under the UNFCCC. The InternationalIndigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change(indigenous caucus), which NARF participates in, didnot achieve all that it sought, but it achieved significantreferences that can be built on going forward. TheAgreement states that, when taking action on climatechange, the rights of indigenous peoples must beacknowledged and that traditional, indigenous knowl-edge shall help guide the science used to address climate change. It also recognizes the need to strength-en that knowledge and establishes a platform for thesharing of information and best practices. Since theParis Agreement, the indigenous caucus has madeefforts to make the traditional knowledge platform a reality. 
In December 2018, the 24th Conference of the Parties
(COP 24) took the historic step of establishing aFacilitative Working Group for the platform. Theworking group, which has seven country representa-tives and seven indigenous representatives appointedby indigenous peoples, met in June 2019. This repre-sentation of indigenous peoples is unprecedented,marking the first time that indigenous representatives(chosen by indigenous peoples) are participating on anequal basis with states within a United Nations body.At the June meeting, the working group prepared atwo-year work plan that was taken to COP 25 andapproved in December 2019.ANNUAL REPORT 2019To promote Native American human rights , NARF focuses
on laws providing equal protection and freedom fromdiscrimination in areas such as voting, education,incarceration, and religion. NARF also helps developlaws that provide unique protections for Native collec-tive rights, traditions, culture, and property such assacred places, peyote, eagle feathers, burial remains,and funerary objects.
ReLIGIO uS FReeDOM AND SACR eD PLAC eS
Bears Ears
For several years, the Bears Ears Inter Tribal Coalition,a consortium of five sovereign Indian nations (HopiTribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute MountainUte Tribe, and Pueblo of Zuni) worked to protect theBears Ears region, America's most significant unpro-tected cultural landscape. The Bears Ears region, locatedin Utah, contains at least 100,000 archaeological sites,some dated back to 12,000 BCE, and remains critical tomany tribes today for spiritual as well as hunting andgathering purposes. In response to these efforts, inDecember 2016, President Obama designated the BearsEars National Monument and established the BearsEars Commission “to provide guidance and recom-mendations on the development and implementationof management plans and on management of the monument.” The Commission included one electedofficer each from the Hopi Nation, Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Ute Indian Tribe, and Puebloof Zuni. 
In April 2017, President Trump directed the
Department of the Interior to review the Bears EarsNational Monument to determine if it was createdwithout “public outreach and proper coordination.”The suggestion that the monument's designationlacked outreach and coordination is disingenuous. TheBears Ears National Monument was created after yearsof advocacy and many public meetings in the BearsEars region and in Washington, DC. The effort to pro-tect Bears Ears was very long, very public, and veryrobust.
Despite an outpouring of public support for Bears
Ears, in December 2017, President Trump issued anExecutive Order revoking and replacing the nationalmonument. Representing the Hopi, Zuni, and UteMountain Ute Tribes, NARF sued the Administrationfor violations of the Antiquities Act, the Separation ofPowers, the Property Clause and the AdministrativeProcedures Act. The government filed a motion to dis-miss and NARF responded on behalf of the Hopi,Zuni, and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes. The court has alsogranted motions to intervene by the State of Utah and
a number of other groups, but imposed stringent con-ditions on them that the Tribes had requested. InOctober 2019, the court denied the government'smotion to dismiss, but instructed the plaintiffs to fileamended complaints. The court will allow the govern-ment to file new motions to dismiss after that. TheTribes filed their amended complaint in November2019 and will file a motion for summary judgment inJanuary 2020. 
Solonex v. Jewell
NARF represented the Blackfeet Tribe as amicus curiaein the federal district court case, Solonex v. Jewell .
Solonex LLC challenged the authority of the UnitedStates to cancel its oil and gas lease in areas that wouldthreaten the Tribe's sacred sites. In 2017 and 2018, theparties completed briefing and oral arguments onmotions for summary judgment and in September2018, the judge entered summary judgement in favorof Solenex, concluding that the lease cancelation was“arbitrary and capricious” because more than 30 yearsof indecision by the agency constituted an unreason-able delay. The judge also concluded that Departmentof the Interior did not give Solenex appropriate noticethat it was canceling the lease, which violated a duty toact in good faith. The plaintiffs appealed the decisionand NARF filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Tribe
in this case and a case with an almost identical legalissue, Moncrief v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior . In October
2019, Moncrief settled, and the leaseholder agreed to
voluntarily relinquish its lease. The Solenex lease is thelast one remaining in the area. That appeal will beargued in January 2020.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. Army Corp of Engineers -
Amicus Brief StrategyNARF and the National Congress of American Indians(NCAI) are assisting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribeand their attorneys to develop and coordinate an effec-tive amicus brief strategy in their lawsuit against the US
Army Corps of Engineers in relation to the DakotaAccess Pipeline (DAPL). In December 2016, the ArmyCorps of Engineers issued a statement that it wouldnot grant an easement to allow the Dakota AccessPipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The Corps deter-mined that further environmental review was warranted.However, in January 2017, President Trump directed theCorps to take “any and all actions appropriate” toreview and approve the easement, rescind or modifythe December memo, and consider any prior determi-nations in the matter. 
Promote Human RightsNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDIn February 2017, the Department of Justice informed
the court that the Corps had provided notice of itsintention to grant an easement to Dakota Access, LLC,to construct a pipeline under Lake Oahe. BothStanding Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River SiouxTribe filed amended complaints and motions for sum-mary judgment challenging the issuance of the ease-ment. NARF, in conjunction with NCAI, coordinatedan amicus brief strategy in support of the Tribes'motions for summary judgment. 
In June 2017, the court issued a favorable ruling for the
Tribes, finding that the Corps “did not adequately con-sider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunt-ing rights, or environmental justice, or the degree towhich the pipeline's effects are likely to be highly con-troversial.” In February and March 2018, the CheyenneRiver Sioux Tribe and Standing Rock Sioux Triberequested that the court issue clearer guidelines for theCorps' consultation with the Tribes in the remandprocess, asserting that the Corps has been unrespon-sive to requests for information and otherwise notmeaningfully engaged with the Tribes in developingan oil spill response plan. In April 2018, Dakota Accessfiled its oil spill response plan, after which the courtdenied the Tribes' request for clarification and consul-tation guidelines, ruling that the request was mootedby the filing of the oil spill response plan.
In August 2018, the Corps issued a decision affirming
its original decision to issue a construction permit forDAPL. The Corps concluded that the “. . . review onremand did not reveal 'significant new circumstance[s]or information relevant to environmental concerns.'The court ordered proposals for post-remand proceed-ings. The Tribes filed motions for summary judgmentin August 2019. NARF filed an amicus brief supportingthe Tribes' motions for summary judgment on behalf of14 tribes and eight tribal organizations. Responses andcross-motions for summary judgment from DakotaAccess and the United States were filed in October2019. NARF and NCAI continue to work with theTribes' attorneys and coordinate amicus strategy as
requested.
National Register of Historic Places Rulemaking
In early 2019, the National Park Service (NPS)announced proposed rulemaking that would changethe regulations that implement the National Register ofHistoric Places (NRHP). Among some minor house-keeping and administrative changes, the NPS pro-posed substantive changes that are targeted specificallyat tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. The changes are intended to prevent traditional cultur-
al properties, cultural landscapes, and places of tradi-tional religious and cultural significance from beinglisted on the NRHP and considered in the Section 106review process. The proposed changes discredit thevalue of protecting these types of cultural resourcesand sideline tribes and Native Hawaiian organizationsin Federal regulatory, planning and permitting. NARFrepresents the Native village of Tyonek in this rule-
making. The public comment period closed in April2019. Initially, the NPS refused to consult with tribes(and Native Hawaiian organizations), but relentedunder significant pressure. The NPS held a single “con-sultation” meeting in Nevada in June 2019, and a sin-gle teleconference in July 2019. The NPS also extendedthe time tribes could comment on the proposed rule-making to July 2019.
Along with over seventy tribes and Native organiza-
tions, NARF submitted extensive comments on theproposed rulemaking on behalf of the Native village of
Tyonek and attended the “consultations.” Of the over3,000 comments the NPS received, only five were insupport of the rulemaking. Currently, the NPS isreviewing the comments it received. 
Native American Church of North America
NARF has represented the Native American Church ofNorth America (NACNA) and its member chapters forfour decades in litigation and legislative action. For thepast two years, NARF has worked to develop and sup-port access to and the use of peyote for NACNA.Importing from Mexico, where most naturally occur-ring peyote grows, is presently not legal, and artificialcultivation is difficult and extraordinarily expensive,so North American peyotists depend on the onlyregion where peyote abundance occurs in the UnitedStates, the Rio Grande River valley in south Texas.
That supply of peyote is becoming less sustainable dueto a myriad of factors: growing Indian demand;exploitation and commercialization by non-Indianpeople; damage from land use practices including cattleranching; and damage from incorrect harvesting practices and over-harvesting of the peyote cactus. 
For the last few years, the Peyote Research Project has
focused on raising awareness in Texas of the need toprotect the sacrament. NARF and NACNA representa-tives have held many meetings with landowners, pey-oteros, and botanists to develop relationships. A meet-ing with Texas Department of Public Safety officialswas held in January 2018 to brief them on the Project
PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTSANNUAL REPORT 2019In 2017, NARF closed on the purchase of 605 acres of
south Texas land, made possible by a grant from theRiverStyx Foundation of California. NARF workedwith Native American Church representatives and thephilanthropy community to create a nonprofit organi-zation to hold title to the land and put a peyote conser-vation project in place. Meetings on the land took placethroughout 2019. Work coordinating with the localranching community continues, and the first of severaladobe structures is underway on the land. 
Graduation Eagle Feather and Regalia Project
Every spring, NARF is contacted by Native Americanstudents from across the country who are being pro-hibited from wearing eagle feathers at graduation cer-emonies. By and large, once schools come to under-stand the religious and cultural significance of eaglefeathers, they make accommodations and exceptionsfor Native American students. Unfortunately, there arestill a handful of school districts that persist in restrict-ing Native American religious liberty and speech. Thisinsistence on uniformity of dress puts NativeAmerican students in the position of having to choosebetween participating in the celebration of a greataccomplishment with their classmates or followingtheir Native religious and cultural traditions. 
For 2019, NARF received more than a dozen student
requests for assistance. When appropriate and asresources permit, NARF may send a letter to the schoolexplaining the religious significance of eagle feathers, andhow both federal and state law protects their use. On occa-sion NARF will pursue litigation on behalf of aggrievedstudents. Additionally, we are in the early stages of explor-ing the viability of targeted legislative campaigns thatcould lead to a “fix” on a state by state basis.
INDIAN eDuCATION
Tribal Education Departments National Assembly
NARF founded the Tribal Education DepartmentsNational Assembly (TEDNA) more than fifteen yearsago with funding from the US Department ofEducation to start a national membership organizationfor Tribal Education Departments (or Agencies). WithNARF's assistance, TEDNA has become a leadingIndian education organization that focuses on tribalgovernance over K-12 education provided by state,federal, and tribal schools. NARF continues to repre-sent TEDNA on national legislative and administrativematters. Recently, NARF has reviewed tribal educationcodes to identify areas for increased tribal governance.NARF also provides training for TEDNA and its part-
ners on various national, state, and tribal educationlegislation and other legal matters. 
In October 2019, TEDNA was awarded a one-year
State-Tribal Education Partnership grant to assist five tribes in virginia (the Chickahominy
Indian Tribe; the Chickahominy Indian Tribe EasternDivision; the Monacan Indian Tribe; the UpperMattaponi Indian Tribe; and, the Pamunkey IndianTribe) establish education departments, develop edu-cation codes, and work with the state to improve edu-cation for tribal students. TEDNA has subcontractedwith NARF to assist with this work.
Also, in October 2019, TEDNA was awarded a
Regional Comprehensive Center grant to assist tribesin Washington, Oregon, and Alaska with their educa-tion departments and state partnerships to improveeducation for tribal students. TEDNA will subcontractwith NARF to assist with the Alaska Native tribesserved by this grant. 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDMcCoy v. Salish Kooetnai College
NARF represents the American Indian HigherEducation Consortium (AIHEC) as amicus curiae in this
case brought against a tribal college by a formeremployee of the college alleging that he was discrimi-nated against by the college in violation of Title vII if
the Civil Rights Act. The college has moved to dismisson the ground that the Confederated Salish andKootenai Tribes have sovereign immunity and the college is an arm of the Tribes. AIHEC sought to partic-ipate on behalf of its 36 member tribal colleges and universities. In April 2018, over the employee's opposi-tion, the court granted AIHEC's motion to file its amicus brief. The court heard oral argument on the 
college's dismissal motion in August 2018. The courtgranted the tribal college's motion to dismiss, but theindividual appealed to the US Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit. In March 2019, AIHEC filed an amicus
brief in support of the college and the Tribes. In November 2019, the appeals court affirmed the district court's dismissal. 
Rosebud Sioux Tribal Education Code Revision Project
In 1987 NARF accepted the request of the RosebudSioux Tribe to develop a precedent-setting tribal edu-cation code to regulate all K-12 schools on it reserva-tion. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe adopted its EducationCode in 1991. In 2015, the Rosebud Sioux Tribereceived a grant from the Department of the Interior torevise its 25-year-old Education Code. The Tribe
retained NARF to do this revision, which is ongoing.

NARF represents the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe indrafting a comprehensive education code. NARF metwith the Leech Lake Education Director, the TribalCouncil, and in-house legal staff in October 2018, andis proceeding with developing the code and gatheringinput from stakeholders.
INDIAN CHILD W eLFAR e ACT D eFeNSe 
The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was passed by
the US Congress in 1978 in response to the dispropor-tionate numbers of American Indian and AlaskaNative children being removed from their families bystate agencies and state courts and placed in non-Native foster or adoptive homes or residential institu-tions. Congress found that many of these removals andplacements were due to state officials' inability orunwillingness to understand tribal cultures and soci-eties. The impact of the removals and placements wasextremely detrimental to the children, their families,and tribes. 
In 2016, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) issued regu-
lations and guidelines for the implementation of ICWA.The past several years have seen a dramatic increase inthe number of legal challenges brought by opponentsof ICWA, all with the goal of undermining ICWA andtribal sovereignty. The ICWA Defense Project is a part-nership formed to protect the rights of children, fami-lies, and tribes in ICWA proceedings nationwide.
Most recently, in October 2018, in the case Brackeen v.
Zinke (in the US District Court for the Northern District
of Texas) the judge ruled that both ICWA and the 2016ICWA regulations are unconstitutional. The argumentsJudge O'Connor relied upon to hold ICWA and the reg-ulations unconstitutional are contrary to theConstitution, congressional intent, and decades ofwell-established federal Indian law. Tribe defendantsasked the United States Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit to stay the decision, which it did, and initiatedthe appeal. NARF worked closely with partners tocoordinate amicus briefs, including a tribal brief, which
was signed by 325 Tribes and 57 Native organizations.The Fifth Circuit held oral argument in March 2019.Weare delighted to report that in August 2019, the FifthCircuit overturned the district court's opinion andaffirmed the constitutionality of ICWA.
PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTSANNUAL REPORT 2019Finally, NARF has been heavily involved in recent
efforts in Alaska to transfer more control over thestate's child welfare system to tribes through a com-pacting process. The Alaska Tribal Child WelfareCompact was signed in October 2017. It allows tribesto enter into an agreement with the state to provideservices and functions that currently are provided bythe Alaska Office of Children's Services. Negotiationsare ongoing.
VOTING AND CIVIL RIGHTSBrakebill, et al. v. Jaeger
In 2016, NARF, on behalf of seven Native Americansfrom North Dakota fought the state's voter ID law,which disproportionately prevented Native Americansfrom exercising their right to vote. Judge Daniel L.Hovland of the US District Court for the District ofNorth Dakota found “[i]t is undisputed that the moresevere conditions in which Native Americans livetranslates to disproportionate burdens when it comesto complying with the new voter ID laws.” JudgeHovland, therefore, held the law likely violated the USConstitution because it disproportionately kept NativeAmericans from voting. He required the state to pro-vide a fail-safe mechanism for those without IDs in the2016 general election. Judge Hovland wrote, “… it isclear that a safety net is needed for those voters whosimply cannot obtain a qualifying voter ID with rea-sonable effort.”
The state legislature amended the law in 2017, but still
failed to include meaningful protections for voters'rights. In December 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint alleging the new law violated the voting
Rights Act and the US and North Dakota Constitutionsbecause of the disproportionate impacts on NativeAmericans. Plaintiffs also alleged that the law's intentwas to burden Native American voters in order to sup-press their vote and that the new law constitutes anillegal property requirement to vote. In April 2018, thecourt stopped enforcement of the new voter ID law.The court ordered the state to accept a much broaderswath of IDs for voting purposes and put a significantamount of power back under tribal control. The stateappealed to the US Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit. In late September, after absentee voting hadbegun, the Eighth Circuit changed the rules of the elec-tion and permitted the state to use residential streetaddresses even though Native communities in thestate often lack them. The Supreme Court upheld thatdecision. In October 2018, the Spirit Lake Tribe and six individ-
ual plaintiffs filed a separate suit the week before theelection seeking a temporary restraining order againstthe implementation of the law. The suit differed slightlyfrom the Brakebill case in that these were individuals
who lacked residential addresses, not just ID. Theywere about to be disenfranchised by the law despitebeing qualified to vote. The Spirit Lake Tribe alsojoined on its own behalf and in its parens patriaecapacity on behalf of its many members whose homesare unmarked or who are moving from home to homeand lack a permanent address. The court denied theorder, citing the closeness to the election, but voicedconcerns. The court also approved an order thatallowed the six individual plaintiffs to vote in the elec-tion. In February 2019, plaintiffs amended the com-plaint and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe joined thesuit. The state moved to dismiss the complaint. Thatmotion is now fully briefed. We are waiting for thecourt to decide the motion to dismiss.
In July 2019, a divided Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
vacated the lower court's injunction in Brakebill. Thecourt acknowledged that Native American voters maybe disenfranchised, but found the lower court's injunc-tion was too broad. Disappointingly, the order from theEighth Circuit again allows North Dakota to continueusing the discriminatory new law, providing no reliefto disenfranchised Native voters.
The plaintiffs in Spirit Lake asked for the case to move
forward so that the case could be decided before the2020 election. The court set a May 2020 trial date. 
Native American Voting Rights Coalition
In 2015, NARF founded the Native American voting
Rights Coalition (NA vRC), a non-partisan alliance of
organizations, scholars, and activists advocating forequal access for Native Americans to the politicalprocess. NARF developed the project to coordinateefforts at overcoming the barriers Native Americansface in registering to vote, casting their ballot, and hav-ing an equal voice in elections. NA vRC employs three
primary methods to achieve its goal. It educates thepublic about the unique challenges Native voters face.It works with policy makers and election officials toaddress those challenges. And, when necessary,NAvRC members may pursue other legal avenues,
including litigation, to stop practices that have a dis-criminatory purpose or effect on Native voters.
One of the significant achievements of the Coalition so
far is the completion of a thirty-tribe survey of overNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND5,000 voters in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and
South Dakota. The results documented widespreaddiscrimination and disenfranchisement. The final sur-vey was released in January 2018. Subsequently, theCoalition completed its second ambitious project: toconduct field hearings throughout Indian Country todocument barriers to registration and voting in non-tribal elections. Information from the hearings willhelp promote public education, identify policy solu-tions, and consideration of other legal remedies toexpand Native access to voting. NARF completed apublic report detailing the findings and is workingtoward a plan to address the problems encountered.That report has been submitted to Congress and will bepublished in early 2020.
The NA vRC, led by NARF, developed a detailed
strategic plan for the 2020 elections and is working onfunding and meeting its many objectives. We havehelped with access efforts, such as opening pollingplaces in Nevada and Arizona for the 2018 election,and now are working to prepare for the 2020 Census inIndian Country. 
Smith v. State
For decades, the Alaska Court System has excluded theresidents of over 150 rural villages from being calledfor jury service. The courts claim that it's too expensiveto include rural residents; however, the exclusion ofrural residents disenfranchises communities withlower incomes and that are predominately AlaskaNative. Not including those communities in the jurypool results in thirty percent of Alaska Natives beingexcluded from participating in the justice system. Itaffects perceptions of the justice system-when exclud-ed from jury service, then one only encounters thecourts as a victim, witness, or defendant. And, it resultsin unrepresentative juries and likely disproportionatesentences.
In February 2017, NARF filed an amicus brief before
the Alaska Court of Appeals in support of AppellantSmith's arguments that costs savings alone are not asufficient government interest, under an equal protec-tion and due process analysis, to exclude thirty percentof the Alaska Native community from serving onjuries. In March 2019, the appeals court held that it wasan error to refuse Smith an evidentiary hearing on theissue of whether the transportation and housing ofprospective jurors from two Native villages wouldpose an unreasonable expense. The case is now backbefore the Superior Court.INTeRNATIONAL R eCOGNITION OF
INDIG eNOuS PeOPLeS
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous PeoplesSince 1999, NARF has represented the NationalCongress of American Indians (NCAI) in the interna-tional arena to protect indigenous rights. In September2007, the United Nations General Assembly over-whelmingly adopted the Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples (Declaration). The Declaration rec-ognizes that indigenous peoples have important col-lective human rights in a multitude of areas, includingself-determination, spirituality, cultural and linguisticheritage, and lands, territories and natural resources. Itsets minimum standards for the treatment of indige-nous peoples and can serve as the basis for the devel-opment of customary international law. 
NARF's most recent actions on behalf of the NCAI
have focused on the participation of indigenous insti-tutions at the United Nations (UN). Until now, indige-nous peoples have had to appear in most UN bodies asnon-governmental organizations, which is preciselywhat they are not. Indigenous peoples' representativesfrom around the world, including one from NCAI, metin November 2016 to discuss areas of consensus.Informal consultations with member states began inDecember 2016 and continued through July 2017. Thisseries of consultations concluded without any realmovement on the issue, but the UN General Assemblycommitted, in September 2017, to continue to considerthe issue for the next five sessions.
In 2018, the Human Rights Council began to establish
an appropriate status for indigenous peoples represen-tatives and institutions to participate. Discussions con-tinued through 2019 and will be taken up at a specialmeeting to be held in Ecuador in January 2020.
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
in Domestic Law ProjectNARF and the University of Colorado Law School (CULaw) are initiating a project to guide the implementa-tion of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples (Declaration) in the United States.The Declaration provides an impetus to redress historicwrongs committed against indigenous peoples andadvance the arc of justice. Guided by traditional values,contemporary challenges in Indian Country, and theneeds of future generations, the goal of the project is torealize the promises of the Declaration in the US.
PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTSANNUAL REPORT 2019The project will research, develop, and execute strate-
gies to bring US law into compliance with theDeclaration. These efforts will include educationalevents and working closely with Native Americanleaders. The project held a conference in March 2019 toshare experiences implementing the provisions of theDeclaration. The event generated substantial input andvaluable discussion. The next step is to generate sum-maries of those discussions, and develop concrete pri-orities and tasks. 
Organization of American States Draft Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous PeoplesThe Organization of American States (OAS) has beenworking on an American Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples for over twenty-five years. NARFhas been representing NCAI on this matter. TheGeneral Assembly of the OAS approved the AmericanDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples inJune 2016. This Declaration marks a major victory forindigenous peoples. The American Declaration goesbeyond the United Nations Declaration on the Rightsof Indigenous Peoples in several respects includingaddressing treaties, the rights of children, and therights of peoples in voluntary isolation. The UnitedStates commented it had been a persistent objector tothe text and could not be bound by it. NARF attendedthe first Inter-American week for Indigenous People in2018 and made office space available to CentralAmerican indigenous representatives presenting at theInter American Commission on Human Rights inDecember 2018.
World Intellectual Property Organization
NARF represents NCAI in the ongoing negotiations foran international instrument to protect various intellectu-al property, including Traditional Knowledge, GeneticResources and Associated Traditional Knowledge(GRAATK), and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCE).The United States has been participating in these nego-tiations at the World Intellectual Property Organization(WIPO) since 2000. Since 2009, the negotiations havecentered on the draft text of the three potential instru-ments concerning TK, GRAATK, and TCE. 
In May 2017, NARF and the University of Colorado
(CU) Law School hosted a drafting session on the TCEinstrument. NARF took draft provisions to the 34thWIPO session in June. The WIPO Indigenous Caucusapproved the draft and some of that text was introducedinto the WIPO draft TCE instrument. In October 2017,the new WIPO Intergovernmental Committee onIntellectual Property and Genetic Resources, TraditionalKnowledge and Folklore (IGC) mandate and work plan
were approved by the WIPO General Assembly. 
Building on that experience, NARF and CU Law host-
ed another drafting session in May 2018 focusing onthe GRAATK instrument. Once again, the draft textwas approved by the Indigenous Caucus, thusstrengthening the Caucus' ability to participate innegotiations. In June 2018, NARF spoke on the IGCIndigenous Panel on “Practical Measures Relating toIntellectual Property and Genetic Resources: Databasesand Contracts - Indigenous Peoples' and LocalCommunities' Perspectives.”
At IGC 39 in March 2019, the Indigenous Caucus met
with the WIPO Secretariat concerning a proposed proj-ect to help educate about indigenous perspectives onseveral issues. NARF is part of the committee that wasformed to spearhead the project. A NARF article sum-marizing the 2018 WIPO IGC negotiations was pub-lished in The Indigenous World 2019 (https://www.iwgia.org/images/documents/indigenous-world/IndigenousWorld2019_UK.pdf).
The theme of the 18th Session of the UN Permanent
Forum on Indigenous Issues in April 2019 was “tradi-tional knowledge.” NARF delivered a statement onbehalf of NCAI requesting recommendations from theForum to the WIPO IGC. Subsequently, in its officialreport of the session the Forum made multiple recom-mendations to WIPO. 
Also in May 2019, in preparation for the IGC 40 
session, a conversation was held in Montreux,Switzerland. NARF, on behalf of NCAI, was the onlyindigenous organization represented at the meeting.The meeting addressed two issues: the status of thenegotiations on genetic resources and associated tradi-tional knowledge; and the mandate and work programfor the 2020-2021 IGC biennium.
IGC 40 took place in June 2019. The text focus was the TK
and TCE texts. Because IGC 40 was the last session of thecurrent biennium, the session also included negotiationson the work program for the 2020/2021 biennium. TheIndigenous Caucus was able to obtain recommendationsfrom the Committee to the WIPO General Assembly forupdating a 2016 technical review and convening anIndigenous expert workshop. Progress also was madefunding indigenous participation, although further workremains to be done. The WIPO General Assemblyapproved the proposed 2020-2021 mandate and workprogram during its annual meeting in fall 2019.NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDWithin the unique trust relationship between the
United States and Native nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsi-bly enforce the laws and regulations applicable toNative peoples. NARF is committed to hold govern-
ments accountable to Native Americans. 
TRuST FuND MATT eRS
Pembina Chippewa v. United States
NARF represents the Turtle Mountain Chippewa,Chippewa Cree, White Earth Band of MinnesotaChippewa, and Little Shell Chippewa Tribes in thiscase against the federal government for misaccountingand mismanagement of their tribal trust fund, thePembina Judgment Fund. Starting in August 2007, theparties engaged in alternative dispute resolution pro-ceedings in the Court of Federal Claims. In July 2015,the parties reached agreement on a monetary amountfor a potential settlement of the Plaintiffs' claims in thiscase. In March 2018, the parties reached agreement onthe non-monetary components of a potential settle-ment. The parties now seek their formal approvals ofthe settlement.Intertribal Council of Arizona v. United States 
In April 2015, NARF filed on behalf of the IntertribalCouncil of Arizona (ITCA) a breach of trust caseagainst the United States seeking damages for mis-management of the Arizona Intertribal Trust Fund(AITF). The AITF was established by Congress in 1988to compensate Arizona tribes for the closure of thePhoenix Indian School, an off-reservation boardingschool operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs since1891. The school’s closure allowed the Department ofthe Interior to exchange the land on which the schoolhad been located for privately owned lands of theBarron Collier Company in Florida that would becomepart of a national wildlife refuge. The Phoenix landswere more valuable than the Florida lands, andCongress approved the land exchange only if the dif-ference in value of the properties went to the AITF anda trust fund for the Navajo Nation. Collier paid some,but not all, of the property value and then gave noticethat they would no longer make payments. The law-suit seeks to hold the United States liable for theremaining payments into the AITF. After failed negoti-ation efforts, ITCA filed its Second AmendmentComplaint in April 2018, which the United StatesHold Governments Accountable
ANNUAL REPORT 2019moved to dismiss. The court granted virtually the
entire motion, dismissing all but a portion of one ofITCA’s claims. In March 2019, the court granted ITCA’smotion for entry of final judgment on the dismissedclaims, allowing ITCA to appeal those claims to the USCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefing hasbeen completed, and the oral argument is scheduledfor February 2020.
Repeal of the Klamath Tribe Distribution 
of Judgment ActThe Klamath Tribe retained NARF to seek repeal of theDistribution of Judgment Fund Act, which was adopt-ed as part of the legislation that terminated the Tribes'government-to-government relationship in 1954. Thatrelationship was restored in 1986, but the remnant leg-islation was not repealed. The Distribution Actrequires distribution of judgments from the UnitedStates Treasury to descendants of those who appear onthe final roll compiled pursuant to the TerminationAct. That would include distribution of tribal funds toa significant number of non-Indians and individualswho are not enrolled members of the Tribes. Repealwould result in funds deposited in the Treasury fromjudgments against the United States being distributedpursuant the Distribution of Judgment Funds Act forall Tribes. Senators Merkley and Wyden introducedS.46 to repeal the act. S.46 was adopted by the Senateand forwarded to the House. The House Subcommitteeon Indigenous Peoples of the United States held a hear-ing; NARF provided testimony in support of adoptionand responded to follow-up questions. S.46 now goesto the full Interior Committee for mark-up; then to thefull House for consideration.
Center for Biological Diversity, et al. v. US Army
Corps of Engineers, et al.NARF represented the Santa Ynez Band of ChumashIndians in a case challenging the issuance of a CleanWater Act Section 404 permit. The proposed NewhallRanch Project area encompasses 12,000 acres along 5.5linear miles of the Santa Clara River and calls for theconstruction of nearly 21,000 homes on approximately2,550 acres. The project area is also the ancestral home-land of Chumash and includes at least two significantarchaeological sites as well as a number of ancientburials. The Corps issued a Clean Water Act Section404 permit to Newhall in October 2012; the suit soonfollowed. The Tribe joined this case to protect theirright to government-to-government consultationunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and theNational Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). TheTribe’s claim is simple: the Corps never contacted,
much less formally consulted, the Tribe about the proj-ect. Thus the Section 404 permit the Corp’s granted toNewhall is in violation of the NHPA and APA. Oralargument was held in February 2017. Subsequently,Newhall began settlement discussions in earnest andthe case was settled in September 2017. The Tribe nego-tiated for cultural resource protections that exceedwhat is required by California and federal law, supportfor their cultural center, and amending of the flawedagreement that previously applied to the project.NARF is now counsel to Santa Ynez to implement theterms of the settlement agreement, including renegoti-ating the programmatic agreement that had previouslyexcluded them.
Blackfeet Tribe et al. v. Federal Communications
Commission, et al.In 2018, the FCC exempted 5G wireless cellular infra-structure from the Section 106 process and tribal con-sultation requirements of the National HistoricPreservation Act (NHPA). (Section 106 requires federalagencies to account for the effects of undertakings onhistoric properties and consult with any tribe that mayattach significance to those properties.) The NHPAgive the Advisory Council on Historic Preservationauthority to administer the Section 106 process. 
In June 2018, NARF and co-counsel, on behalf of the
Blackfeet Tribe, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, theFort Belknap Indian Community, the Rosebud SiouxTribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and United Southand Eastern Tribes, Inc, sued the FCC in the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Briefingwas completed, and oral argument was held in March2019.
In August 2019, the court issued its opinion largely
holding the FCC’s rulemaking as unlawful. In particu-lar, the court held that the FCC had failed to provide areasoned explanation for why it was within the publicinterest to exempt the deployment of 5G infrastructurefrom review. In October 2019, the FCC issued a neworder reinstating review for 5G infrastructure. NARFwill continue to work with its clients and partners toensure that places of traditional religious and culturalsignificance are protected from 5G infrastructuredeployment.NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDNARF’s maintains several projects to develop Indian law
and educate the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues.NARF also participates in numerous conferences andevents to share its knowledge and expertise in Indianlaw. NARF is firmly committed to sharing its legalexpertise in support of Indian rights.
INDIG eNOuS PeACeMAKING INITIATIV e 
Indigenous peacemaking is a community-directed con-
flict resolution process that addresses the concerns ofall interested parties. The peacemaking process usestraditional rituals such as the group circle and Clanstructures to involve the parties to a conflict, their supporters, elders and interested community mem-
bers. Within the circle, people can speak from the heartin a shared search for understanding of the conflict,and together identify the steps necessary to assist inhealing all affected parties and to prevent future occur-rences and conflicts. Learn more from the IPI video athttp://bit.ly/IPI-video. 
The IPI team continues to be very busy. Trainings and
technical assistance for tribes are a primary focal pointfor the project. In November 2019, we completed atwo-day advanced level peacemaking training for thePueblo of Isleta Tribal Courts. The Oglala LakotaChildren’s Resource Center continues to coordinatewith IPI as they seek a peacemaking option for chil-dren-at-risk cases. Other recent presentations includeNaropa University Peace Studies, Assembly ofManitoba Chiefs, Winnipeg, Boulder QuakerIndigenous Peoples Concerns Committee, law schools,bar associations, and indigenous communities. We alsorecently produced a paper on the support for peace-making found in the United Nations Declaration of theRights of Indigenous Peoples. 
THe NATIONAL INDIAN LAW LIBRAR y 
The National Indian Law Library (NILL) is the only
publicly available law library in the United Statesdevoted to Indian law. In addition to the service that itprovides to NARF’s attorneys, the library is an invalu-able resource supporting Indian Law and educatingthe public on Indian Law issues. For example, thelibrary’s website (www.narf.org/nill/) recorded266,000 users and 349,000 sessions in 2019.Additionally, each week, NILL provides free updatesthrough the Indian Law Bulletins (www.narf.org/nill/bulletins/). Almost 8,000 subscribers receive thebulletin updates by email. In August 2019, LibraryDirector Anne Lucke was one of three speakers for anAmerican Bar Association, Native American ResourcesCommittee, webinar on Researching Federal IndianLaw and Tribal Law. She also will present a webinar on NILL resources for 6th Circuit court librarians inearly 2020.Develop Indian Law
ANNUAL REPORT 2019Based on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2019, NARF reports total revenue andnet assets of $13,044,003 and $44,426,252, respectively.  Dueto presentation requirements of the audited financial state-ments in terms of recognizing the timing of certain revenuesand expenses, they do not reflect the fact that based onNARF’s internal reporting, revenue exceeded expenses andother cash outlays resulting in an increase of $19,934 toNARF’s reserve fund.
When compared to fiscal year 2018:  The increase in public
contributions is mostly due to receiving almost $1.2 millionmore in bequests (this area can vary widely from one year tothe next).  The increase in tribal contributions is mostly due
to a generous $1 million donation from a tribe that we’ve hada long-time relationship with.  Federal awards relate to ourBureau of Justice Assistance contracts, the majority of whichis also included in expenses since it is paid-out to sub-recip-ients.  The decrease in foundation grants is due to receivingadditional new grants in the prior year restricted to ourimportant projects and cases (many of these grants are mul-tiyear and continued on into fiscal year 2019 and beyond).The decrease in legal fees is mostly related to the reducedneeds for two of our largest clients/cases.
