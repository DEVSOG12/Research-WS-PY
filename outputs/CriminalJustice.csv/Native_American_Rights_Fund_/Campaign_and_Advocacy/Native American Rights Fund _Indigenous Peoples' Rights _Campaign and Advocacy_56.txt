Since 1995, the United Nations has designated August 9 as the annual International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. The day marks an occasion to celebrate the achievements of Indigenous Peoples and to highlight the continued work necessary to protect and promote the rights of Indigenous Peoples throughout the world.For decades Indigenous Peoples around the world have worked to define and advocate for the global recognition of their basic human rights. These efforts led to the creation of the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration sets out the minimum level of human rights protections that Indigenous Peoples in the U.S. and beyond must regain, retain, or secure to survive and flourish. While some regulations in the U.S. already meet these baseline standards, many fall short.Through The Implementation Project, the Native American Rights Fund and the University of Colorado Law School support tribes and tribal governments and their allies in taking the next steps: advocating for implementation of the Declaration’s promises into binding domestic law and policy. The Implementation Project works to ensure that tribal advocates are able to use this important tool to its full potential.To support this work, The Implementation Project, in partnership with the UCLA  School of Law, created the Tribal Implementation Toolkit, a resource  that provides tribal leaders, lawyers, advocates, and allies with information about the Declaration and examples of effective implementation. The Implementation Project also holds conferences, collaborative workshops, and other events aimed at connecting with activists and leaders on the ground to provide information about the Declaration and the ongoing efforts to implement its standards in the U.S.Learn more about these efforts at: https://un-declaration.narf.org/#WeAreIndigenousMore blog postsShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
