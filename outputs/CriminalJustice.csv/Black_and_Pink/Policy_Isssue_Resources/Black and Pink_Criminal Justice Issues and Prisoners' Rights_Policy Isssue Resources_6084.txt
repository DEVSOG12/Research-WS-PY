We will always be partners with those impacted by the prison industrial complex, the atrocities it enacts, and we will not rest until it is completely dismantled. Because we not only imagine a world without prisons, we demand it.Black & Pink History2005● Black & Pink founded in Boston by Jason Lydon.● The organization began as an explicitly anarchist project, so the name was chosen to represent the black flag of anarchism and the power of queer politics and experience.2006●	First public action, disrupting the Cambridge, MA National Coming Out Day event at City Hall.
