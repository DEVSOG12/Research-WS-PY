The PenPal Program now supports more than 20,000 inside members nationwide, and matches community members across the country with our inside family for friendship, support, and advocacy.Many years ago, Andrew Aleman, our Director of Programs, said to me: Relationships are an intervention. Relationships are key to community and this is where the potential for radical transformation lives. This new PenPal site will make sure that we continue to shed the light of community in every dark corner of institutions across the country.Thousands of our inside members are waiting for PenPals – Check out our new site today and begin supporting our inside family! In solidarity,Dominique MorganBlack & Pink Executive DirectorPost navigation← Previous PostNext Post →General Inquiries​Black & Pink National is a national 501c3 organization based in Omaha, NE.2406 Fowler Ave Suite 316, Omaha, NE 68111admin@blackandpink.orgFacebook-fTwitterInstagramEnvelopeSign up to connect withBlack & Pink National!Black & Pink National is a prison abolitionist organization dedicated to abolishing the criminal punishment system and liberating LGBTQIA2S+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS who are affected by that system through advocacy, support, and organizing.Authorized Safe Housing Network PartnerCopyright ©2022 Black And Pink | Powered by Catapult Consulting SolutionsPrivacy PolicyTermsSitemapScroll to TopPlease join our annual Holiday Card Campaign & send some love & care to our incarcerated family this holiday season!Head over to this blog post or our PenPal Pairing Site to learn more and register today!
