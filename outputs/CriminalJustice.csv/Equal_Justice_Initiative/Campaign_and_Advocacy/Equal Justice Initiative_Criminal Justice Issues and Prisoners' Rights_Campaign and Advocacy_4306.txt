QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
 
1. Does imposition of a li fe-without-parole sentence 
on a 14-year-old child convicted of homicide violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments’ prohibition 
against cruel and unusual punishments? 
2. Does such a sentence violate the Eighth and 
Fourteenth Amendments when it is imposed upon a 
14-year-old child as a result of a mandatory sentenc-ing scheme that categorically precludes consideration 
of the offender’s young age or any other mitigating 
circumstances?

OPINIONS BELOW 
 The opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal 
Appeals is reported at 63 So. 3d 676 and appears in 
the Joint Appendix at J.A. 131-90. That opinion 
withdrew the court’s previous opinion, substituted a 
new opinion, and overruled petitioner Evan Miller’s application for rehearing. The order of the Alabama 
Supreme Court denying a petition for a writ of certio-
rari to review the judgme nt of the Alabama Court of 
Criminal Appeals is unreported and is reproduced at 
J.A. 191-92. 
--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------  
 
JURISDICTION 
 This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1257(a). The initial judgment of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was issued on June 25, 2010. On 
August 27, 2010, that court overruled a timely appli-
cation for rehearing, withdrew its opinion, and sub-stituted a new opinion. The Alabama Supreme Court 
denied Evan’s timely petition for certiorari to the 
Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals on October 22, 2010. On January 13, 2011, Justice Thomas extended 
the time for filing a petition for certiorari until March 
21, 2011. The petition was filed on that date. 
--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------

RELEVANT CONSTITUT IONAL PROVISIONS 
 The Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution provides: 
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor ex-
cessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 
It bears upon the States through the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------  
 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
 Petitioner Evan Miller’s case will be heard by 
this Court in tandem with Jackson v. Hobbs , No. 10-
9647. The petitioners’ briefs in the two cases have been drafted with a view to sparing the Court redun-
dant reading insofar as possi ble. The central constitu-
tional arguments for both petitioners are most fully developed in the Jackson  brief. The present brief 
summarily reprises those arguments and adds mate-
rial specifically relevant to Evan Miller’s circum-stances. Counsel respectfully suggest that the briefs 
will be best understood if th e Brief for Petitioner in 
Jackson  [hereinafter “the Jackson  brief ”] is read 
before this one.

--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------  
 
 1 Petitioner Evan Miller incorporates all of the arguments 
in the Jackson  brief except those in Part H of the Jackson  Ar-
gument section, which are unique to the Jackson  record. 3 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
A. The Course of Proceedings and Presenta-
tion of the Constitutional Issues in the 
Courts Below  
 Evan Miller was arrested in 2003 at the age of 14 
and transferred to the Lawrence County, Alabama, 
Circuit Court ( Ex parte E.J.M. , 928 So. 2d 1081 (Ala. 
2005)), where he was indicted for two counts of capi-
tal murder of Mr. Cole Cannon. J.A. 1; C. 10-11.2 Be-
fore trial, defense counsel moved for a declaration that Alabama’s mandatory life-without-parole sen-
tence could not constitutionally be applied to a 14-
year-old charged with capital murder. J.A. 20-21. The motion was denied. J.A. 22. 
 Following a jury trial, Evan was convicted of 
capital murder in the course of an arson but acquitted 
of capital murder in the course of a robbery. J.A. 70, 
77; C. 93. On the same day and without further 
proceedings, he was senten ced to life imprisonment 
without parole. J.A. 70-72. Counsel filed a new-trial 
motion arguing that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole imposed upon a 
young adolescent violates the Eighth and Fourteenth 
Amendments (J.A. 80-87) and presenting uncontro-verted evidence of the rarity of such sentences 
(J.A. 127-30). The motion al so challenged the imposi-
tion of a mandatory life-without-parole sentence on a 
 
 2 “C.” refers to the clerk’s record in the appellate record be-
low. “R.” refers to the trial transcript. 4 
14-year-old without consideration of his youth or 
other mitigating circumstances. J.A. 87-92. The Cir-
cuit Court denied the motion. J.A. 100. Evan was sent 
to state prison. J.A. 4, 78. 
 Evan’s counsel appealed to the Alabama Court of 
Criminal Appeals, raising both a categorical chal-lenge to the constitutionality of a life-without-parole 
sentence for a 14-year-old and a challenge to the 
imposition of a mandatory life-without-parole sen-tence on a child of that age.  Brief of Appellant at 7-29, 
Miller v. State , No. CR-06-0741 (Ala. Crim. App. June 
6, 2007). The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals af-firmed, ruling that “Miller’s sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of pa role – the se cond harshest 
sentence – for capital mu rder does not violate the 
Eighth Amendment.” J.A. 151; Miller v. State , 63 
So. 3d 676, 691 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010). The court 
concluded that the seriousness of the offense of capi-tal murder supported a life-without-parole sentence 
regardless of the offender’s age. J.A. 148-51; Miller , 
63 So. 3d at 689-91. It furth er held that Evan’s chal-
lenge to the mandatory nature of his sentence was 
foreclosed by Harmelin v. Michigan , 501 U.S. 957, 
995-96 (1996); its opinion did not address the impact of his age on this aspect of the case. J.A. 151-52; 
Miller , 63 So. 3d at 691. 
 Evan’s timely application for rehearing was de-
nied after the court substituted a new opinion making 
alterations not presently relevant. J.A. 7, 190. The Alabama Supreme Court denied Evan’s timely peti-
tion for certiorari. J.A. 191-92. On March 21, 2011, a 5 
petition for certiorari was f iled with this Court. On 
November 7, 2011, the Court granted it and directed 
that the case be argued in tandem with Jackson v. 
Hobbs , 10-9647. J.A. 193. 
 
B. Evan’s Background, Offense, and Arrest  
 Evan grew up under conditions of violent physi-
cal abuse, extreme neglect, and severe poverty. Both his parents were alcoholics and his mother was also 
addicted to illegal drugs. J.A.  26. The family moved so 
often that, at trial, his mother could not recall all the schools Evan had attended. J.A. 66-67. 
 Evan’s father frequently beat Evan, his mother, 
and his siblings severely. J.A. 26, 61-63. After one 
such incident, Evan attempted to hang himself in 
order to escape his father’s  violence. J.A. 28, 63. Evan 
was five years old at this time. J.A. 63. He went on to 
attempt suicide five more times during his childhood. 
J.A. 63-64. At age six he began receiving mental health treatment (J.A. 29) and was then treated in-
termittently by several local mental health centers 
(J.A. 60). He also attempted to escape his brutalizing environment by drinking and using drugs, beginning 
as early as age eight. J.A. 27; see also  J.A. 64-65.  
 When Evan was ten, state authorities finally 
responded to his father’s abuse by removing Evan 
and his siblings from their home and placing them in foster care. J.A. 26, 61. Hi s parents divorced at that 
time. J.A. 44. After he was returned to the custody 
of his drug-addicted mother a few years later, she 6 
continued to fail to provide him with the most basic 
necessities or even minima l supervision. J.A. 33, 62-
63, 67, 68; R. 1251. With no guidance or support, 
Evan followed his parents’ models: his own drug addiction continued to escalate, ultimately leading to 
daily off-label ingestion of prescription medications in 
addition to frequent use of marijuana and crystal methamphetamines. J.A. 27. 
 In this environment, late at night on July 15, 
2003, Evan’s 52-year-old neighbor, Cole Cannon, 
interrupted Evan, his family, and his friend Colby 
Smith as they prepared to go  to bed. J.A.  132; R. 710. 
Evan was then 14 years old; Colby Smith was 16. 
R. 1022. Mr. Cannon, who was visibly intoxicated 
(J.A. 132), made a drug deal with Evan’s mother within earshot of the two boys. R. 1004. Later, when 
Mr. Cannon returned to his own home, the two boys 
accompanied him. Mr. Cannon gave them alcohol and asked the boys to go  buy some marijuana with 
money that he provided. R. 710, 1008, 1012. The 
three of them smoked the marijuana and played drinking games. J.A. 132-33. Evan was highly intoxi-
cated after consuming almost a fifth of whiskey and 
two Klonopin
3 pills in addition to the marijuana. J.A. 
45, 138. Colby Smith testified at Evan’s trial that the 
 
 3 Klonopin is a psychiatric drug  used to treat anxiety which, 
when taken with alcohol, enhances alcohol’s disinhibiting and judgment-impairing effects. R. 1170-73. 7 
boys planned to steal Mr. Cannon’s wallet. J.A. 132; 
R. 981.4 
 At some point while the boys were at Mr. Cannon’s 
home, an altercation began. The cause of the alterca-
tion was disputed, but both  boys agreed that Mr. 
Cannon initiated the physical aggression by grabbing Evan’s throat. J.A. 133; R.  710-11, 984. Colby Smith 
admitted at trial that he reacted by beating Mr. 
Cannon in the head with a baseball bat. J.A. 133. Colby Smith testified that Evan later hit Mr. Cannon 
with the bat (J.A. 133), although Evan himself told 
police that he had hit Mr. Cannon with his fists (R. 711). Colby Smith also testified that Evan then 
put a sheet over his head and said, “I am God, I’ve 
come to take your life.” J. A. 133. Both boys started 
fires in Mr. Cannon’s home. J.A. 133. As they were 
doing so, Mr. Cannon asked Colby, “[W]hy are y’all 
doing this to me?” J.A. 133- 34. The boys left. R. 991. 
Mr. Cannon died later that morning of smoke inhala-
tion. J.A. 137. 
 A week later, Evan was brought to the police sta-
tion and interrogated regarding Mr. Cannon’s death. 
R. 699-701. After two hours of questioning by adults 
(R. 656), he signed an incu lpatory statement written 
  
 
 4 In exchange for testifying against Evan, 16-year-old Colby 
Smith was permitted to plead guilty to felony murder and was sentenced to life with parole eligibility. R. 1037. 8 
by the investigating office r (R. 773) and was then ar-
rested (R. 714). 
--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------  
 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
 The constitutional logic of Roper v. Simmons  and 
Graham v. Florida  requires the invalidation of a 
mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed on a 14-year-old child.  
 As a class, children 14 and younger are inherently 
characterized by internal attributes and external 
circumstances which preclude a finding of the degree 
of culpability that would make their consignment to life-long incarceration with no hope of release consti-
tutionally permissible under Eighth Amendment ex-
cessiveness analysis. This is no less true in murder cases than in other cases of violent crimes by young 
teens. The Summary of Argument at pages 5-6 in the 
Jackson  brief outlines this submission. 
 The mandatory nature of the life-without-parole 
sentence imposed on Evan Miller provides an inde-pendently sufficient ground for its invalidation. The 
cornerstone of the Eighth Amendment analysis which 
informed this Court’s Roper  and Graham  decisions is 
that youth and its attendant features have a critical 
role to play in determining an adolescent’s culpability. 
To wholly disregard a 14-year-old offender’s age and age-related characteristics in sentencing him to be 
  9 
imprisoned for the remainder of his existence makes 
a mockery of this fundamental precept.

ARGUMENT 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LOGIC OF ROPER V. 
SIMMONS  AND GRAHAM V. FLORIDA  CON-
TROLS THIS CASE.  
 The Jackson  brief painstakingly examines this 
Court’s decisions in Roper v. Simmons , 543 U.S. 551 
(2005), and Graham v. Florida , 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010).5 
To avoid tedious repetition here, a very brief sum-mary of the Court’s reasoning in those cases is in 
order:  
 
A. The Eighth Amendment Reasoning of Roper  
and Graham   
 The cases start from the settled premise that the 
Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments which are 
excessive in relation to the moral culpability of the 
offender. Roper , 543 U.S. at 560; Graham , 130 S. Ct. 
at 2021. Both opinions explain and document in 
meticulous detail why the moral culpability of adoles-
cent children cannot be judged in the same way as that of adults. 
 
 5 See the opening of the Argument section and Part A of the 
Argument (pp. 6-15) in the Jackson  brief. 10 
 Adolescents are unfinished products, works-in-
progress toward the adult character they have not yet 
formed. They are flooded by the hormonal surges of 
puberty; their underdeveloped brain structure and their lack of experience with the world leave them 
inadequately equipped to cope with the sensation-
seeking, risk-taking impulses that they experience. The physiological growth and social acculturation 
which underlie adult behavioral controls are incom-
plete in them. They are uniquely subject to peer pressure and bad external influences. Economic and 
cultural realities and a p halanx of laws enacted to 
“protect” them combine to limit their ability to modify their surroundings or to move out of settings that 
provide unwholesome conditions of upbringing. These 
handicaps of immaturity and  limitations of coping 
capability come to them through no fault of their own: 
In their early teens, they have not yet had a chance to 
take charge of their own lives and destinies. But that will change. Precisely because their signature charac-
teristics are transitory, these children themselves are 
bound to change as they mature. Predicting what they will become is chancy, speculative, unreliable.  
 For all of these reasons, it is constitutionally im-
permissible to make a final, irrevocable judgment 
that a young teenager will forever be unsuited for life 
in free society and must be consigned to “die in prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain re-
lease, no matter what he might do to demonstrate 
that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character, even if he spends 11 
the next half century attempting to atone for his 
crimes and learn from his mistakes,” Graham , 130 
S. Ct. at 2033. 
 The core holding in Graham  is that the Eighth 
Amendment forbids juvenile sentences that provide 
“no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance for reconciliation with society, no hope.” 130 
S. Ct. at 2032. Of course, that holding was rendered 
in the context of a nonhomicide crime. Respecting the settled practice of the Co urt “never to anticipate a 
question of constitutional law in advance of the ne-
cessity of deciding it,”
6 Graham  forbore to address the 
question of whether its prohibition of lifelong incar-
ceration of juvenile nonhomici de offenders applies to 
juvenile homicide offenders as well. But Roper did  
consider juvenile homicide offenders, and Roper ’s rea-
sons for holding that they could not be sentenced to 
die even for the crime of murder do not differ in any 
appreciable regard from Graham ’s explicit rationale. 
Logically, Graham  and Roper  together establish an 
analytic framework which compels the conclusion 
that a life-without-parole murder sentence imposed 
on a 14-year-old child like Evan Miller violates the 
Eighth Amendment.

B. The Sources of Information About Adoles-
cence Recognized by Roper  and Graham  
and Their Teaching Regarding the Relevant 
Characteristics of Young Teens in Particular  
 The reasoning common to Graham  and Roper  is 
also instructive regarding the sources to be consulted 
for insight into the features of adolescence which bear upon the culpability of young teens who commit 
murder. In assessing the moral culpability of juvenile 
offenders convicted of aggravated homicides, the Court in Roper  noted that “scientific and sociological 
studies” of child development confirm what “any 
parent knows” about the frailties and vulnerability of adolescents. 543 U.S. at 569. Graham  looked to 
“developments in psychology and brain science [that] 
continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.” 130 S. Ct. at 2026. The 
Roper  opinion collected (in its Appendices B, C, and 
D, 543 U.S. at 581-88) a multit ude of state laws that, 
by denying adolescents the right to make important 
judgments reserved for adults, recognize the “com-
parative immaturity and irresponsibility of juve-niles.” Id. at 569. 
 All of these sources of information are canvassed 
in the Jackson  brief.

teens specifically and to ad d a few details particular 
to young teens. 
 
1. The Scientific Consensus Regarding the 
Relative Developmental Immaturity of Younger Teens  
 The factors which Roper  and Graham  recognized 
as critical for Eighth Amendment analysis in the case 
of adolescents – biologically based volatility and 
impetuosity,
8 underdeveloped self-control systems, in-
experience resulting in de ficient judgment, suscepti-
bility to pressure from peers to engage in risky, 
antisocial, acting-out behavior, inability to structure their own environment or leave it even when it 
is destructive – are at their peak in young teens. 
Fourteen-year-olds find them selves in an especially 
precarious period of heightened vulnerability to im-
pulsive, venturesome experimentation because they 
are trapped in “[t]he temporal gap between the arousal of the socioemotional system, which is an 
early adolescent development, and the full matura-
tion of the cognitive control system, which occurs later.”

Justice , 5 Ann. Rev. Clinical Psychol. 47, 54 (2009). 14 
 This is largely a matter of immature psychologi-
cal and neurological development10 and of having had 
too little time to learn ways of adjusting to their own 
drives and to the frustrations of the world around them without battling it. Middle-schoolers of 13 and 
14 lack even the limited resources of reflectiveness, 
sense of self (including self-worth and future orienta-tion), and ability to say “no”  to peers that older teens 
and adults eventually acquire.
11 They have limited 
foresight of consequences12 and are drawn to take 
risks rather than to avoid them.13 Perhaps most 
important from the standpoint of the Graham-Roper  
analysis, they are just on th e threshold of a period of 
growth and change that will radically remake them. 
“[A]dolescence is second only  to the neonatal period 
in terms of both rapid biopsychosocial growth as well as changing environmental characteristics and

tudes of Autonomy in Early Adolescence,  57 Child Dev. 841, 846

the extensive maturation that occurs progressively throughout middle and late adolescence
14 will alter 
their character and greatly increase their ability to 
regulate impulses and resist external forces that can predispose them to criminal behavior.

2. The Legislative Recognition That Chil-
dren in Their Early Teens Are Unready 
for Full Responsibility   
 “The law has historically reflected the same as-
sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess 
only an incomplete ability to understand the world 
around them.” J.D.B. v. North Carolina , 131 S. Ct. 
2394, 2403 (2011). The peculiar need of younger 
teenagers for insulation from the harms that they can 
suffer through their own limited comprehension and poor judgment, no less than from exploitation by 
other individuals and institutions, is recognized by a 
wide array of state and fede ral statutes that distin-
guish between older adolesce nts and younger ones in 
the degrees of protection they afford and of self-
autonomy they permit. See infra Appendix A. Several 
dozen such enactments can be found in Alabama alone.

 22 See note 14 at page 22 of the Jackson  brief. These gradu-
ated licensing laws followed federal government and industry studies showing that teenage drivers’ immaturity, inexperience, and propensity for risk-taking makes them the most likely drivers to be involved in a fatal crash. See U.S. Gov’t Accounta-

majority of states (41) do  not allow 14-year-olds to 
drive under any circumstances; and all but five of the 
43 states that permit 15-ye ar-olds to drive require 
adult supervision.23 Laws in 45 states restrict the 
number of passengers that teen drivers can carry.24 
 
3. The Particular Unreliability and Harsh-
ness of a Life-Without-Parole Sentence for Younger Teens

juveniles from adults also put them at a significant 
disadvantage in criminal proceedings.” 130 S. Ct. at 
2032. And in the setting of  an adversarial procedure 
for determining guilt and the degree of an offender’s

aspx. In fact, “[t]he fatal crash rate per million miles for 16-year-old drivers is more than 7 times the rate for drivers aged 30 to 
59 years.” Li-Hui Chen et al., Carrying Passengers as a Risk 
Factor for Crashes Fatal to 16- and 17-Year-Old Drivers , 283 J. 
Am. Med. Assn. 1578, 1578 (2000).

22; see also  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
supra  note 22, at 3-7. 
 24 Insurance Institut e for Highway Safety , supra  note 22. 
Studies show that the incidence of fatal motor vehicle crashes involving 16- and 17-year-old drivers increases with the number of passengers, especially teenage passengers. Driving after drinking alcohol or using drugs,  speeding, swervi ng, crossing the 
center line, purposely skidding, and running a red light were strongly associated with the presence of peers. Li-Hui Chen et al., supra  note 22, at 1581. 20 
guilt, disadvantage entails the danger of unreliability. 
Graham ’s observation that “[ j]uveniles mistrust 
adults and have limited understandings of the crimi-
nal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it” ( id.) is especially cogent in the case 
of younger teens.
25 They are peculiarly at risk of 
erroneous convictions and offense-degree determina-tions
26 and they are at even greater risk of erroneous 
predictions of culpability and incorrigibility.27  
 Graham  further recognized that a life-without-
parole sentence “alters the o ffender’s life by a forfei-
ture that is irrevocable” ( 130 S. Ct. at 2027) and that 
the severity of the forfeiture is greater in proportion 
 
 25 See notes 45-48 and accompanying text at pages 38-39 of 
the Jackson  brief; see also  Daniel Seagrave & Thomas Grisso, 
Adolescent Development and the Measurement of Juvenile Psychopathy , 26 Law & Human Behav. 219, 226 (2002) (adoles-
cence is time of dramatic changes in identity, during which an adolescent may present an “insincere and seemingly choreo-graphed social facade, either by attempting to manage peers’ impressions or because they are ‘trying on’ a not yet established personality style, which can be misinterpreted as the manipula-tive, false, and shallow features of the psychopathic offender”). 
 
26 See, e.g. , Thomas Grisso et al., Juveniles’ Competence to 
Stand Trial , 27 Law & Hum. Behav. 333, 356 (2003) (finding that 
one of every three 11- to 13-year-olds and one of every five 14- to 15-year-olds showed impairments in competency that would result in a mentally ill adult being found incompetent to stand trial).

preceding them. 21 
to the youth of the offender who suffers it.28 Not only 
is a young teen deprived of  more years than an older 
one, but these years are ye ars of special importance. 
As Graham  pointed out, “it is the policy in some 
prisons to withhold counseling, education, and reha-
bilitation programs for those who are ineligible for 
parole consideration.” Id. at 2033. For young teens, 
the deprivation of these supports at the formative 
stage of life which they are just entering – a period 
that “is second only to th e neonatal period in . . . 
rapid biopsychosocial growth as well as changing 
environmental characteristics and demands”29 – is 
cruelly calculated to cripple their “potential to attain a mature understanding of . . . [their] own humanity” 
(Roper , 543 U.S. at 574). 
 
C. The Singularly Problematic Status of Man-
datory Life-Without-Parole Sentences for 
Young Teens Under Roper  and Graham   
 There is no mistaking the central perception 
which underlies the Eighth Amendment rulings and 
reasoning in Roper  and Graham . Juveniles are cate-
gorically different than adults because they have 
not reached the stage of development at which a 
 
 28 “Under this sentence, a juvenile offender will on average 
serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.” Id. at 2028. For this reason, “[a] 16-
year-old and a 75-year-old each se ntenced to life without parole 
receive the same punishment in name only.” Id.  
 
29 See the text at pages 14-15 supra , between notes 13 and 14. 22 
definitive judgment can reliably or fairly be made 
that their incorrigibility or degree of culpability 
warrants their permanent, irrevocable expulsion from 
society. If that was true of older adolescents like 
Christopher Simmons and Terrance Graham, it is 
true a fortiori  of 14-year-olds like Evan Miller and 
Kuntrell Jackson. So, even had the life-without-parole sentences of these young teens been imposed 
after thorough-going consideration of their individual 
crimes, characters, and life circumstances – as the sentences of Christopher Simmons and Terrance 
Graham were – they would be starkly at odds with 
the Roper  and Graham  decisions. 
 That is not, however, the factual or constitutional 
worst of it. For Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson were sentenced to life without parole as a mandatory 
consequence of their convictions for murder, with no 
consideration of their individual crimes, characters, life circumstances, or even of their young age. Man-
datory  life-without-parole sent encing of young teens 
introduces added Eighth Amendment difficulties of two kinds: 
 
1. Mandatory Sentences Are Especially 
Problematic as a Measure of the Accept-ability of Life Without Parole as a Proper 
Punishment in Light of Contemporary 
Standards of Decency.  
 Graham  reaffirmed the well-established principle 
that “[a]ctual sentencing practices are an important 23 
part of the Court’s inquiry into consensus.” 130 S. Ct. 
at 2023. Their importance, as the Court explained in 
Enmund  v. Florida , 458 U.S. 782 (1982), arises from 
the consideration that “the jury . . . is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values 
because it is so directly in volved” in the individual-
ized sentencing determinations required in death penalty cases.  Id. at 794 (quoting Coker v. Georgia , 
433 U.S. 584, 596 (1977), quoting Gregg v. Georgia , 
428 U.S. 153, 181 (1976)); and see Thompson v. Okla-
homa , 487 U.S. 815, 831-33 (1988)  (observing that the 
Court has examined the behavior of juries “in deter-
mining the acceptability of capital punishment to the American sensibility”). 
 Case-by-case sentencing decisions are a reliable 
measure of consensus about the appropriateness of 
capital punishment because “[a] central feature of 
death penalty sentencing is a particular assessment of the circumstances of the crime and the characteris-
tics of the offender. The system is designed to con-
sider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances, 
including youth, in every case.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 
572. In the aggregate, the number of death sentences 
imposed (and carried out) is a significant indicator of society’s acceptance of capital punishment for 
entire categories of defe ndants because that number 
reflects choices made by sentencing juries and judges 
who were obliged to consider  and give effect to all 
relevant circumstances, including youth, which bear 
upon the fit between culpability and sentence. See 
Lockett v. Ohio , 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978). In contrast, 24 
mandatory life-without-parole sentences, imposed 
automatically upon conviction without consideration 
of the offender’s age or any other mitigating circum-
stances, do not reflect the considered determination of a sentencing jury or judge about the appropriateness 
of the sentence. 
 It is therefore informat ive to consider the proce-
dures through which the present population of of-
fenders serving sentences of  life without parole for 
murder at age 14 or younger received those sen-
tences. As noted in the Jackson  brief, that total 
population, accumulated over the 40 years since 1971, is approximately 79.
30 Only eight of the 79 were 
sentenced to life imprisonment without parole under 
discretionary sentencing schemes.31 The remainder,

90% of the individuals sentenced to life without 
parole in the past four decades, were given those 
sentences automatically upon conviction, under 
mandatory sentencing regimes. Only two of the eight non-mandatory life-without-parole sentences were 
imposed within the past ten years.
32 Plainly, where 
sentencers have had discretion to consider a lesser sentence, they have almost always chosen it as the 
fitting punishment for murder committed by a young 
teen. 
 
2. Mandatory Life-Without-Parole Sentenc-
ing Denies Juveniles Any Consideration 
of the Mitigating Force of Youth, in Stark 
Disregard of the Recognition in Roper  
and Graham  That Youth Is a Factor of 
Critical Importance  in Proportioning 
Punishment to an Adolescent’s Offense.  
 Roper  and Graham  hold that the special charac-
teristics of youth require consideration in determin-
ing whether a sentence which “alters the offender’s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable” ( Graham , 130 
S. Ct. at 2027) is constitutionally excessive. No sense

at all can be made of these precedents if they do not 
stand for that basic proposition at the least. Imposi-
tion of a mandatory life-without-parole sentence on 
an adolescent – such as Ev an Miller has received – 
denies the adolescent any consideration of his age or 
of the relevance of its spec ial, signature characteris-
tics before he is exclud ed from normal human society 
for the rest of his lifetime. It is impossible to square 
that denial with the deepest, most indisputable, and 
most rudimentary understanding of Roper  and Gra-
ham.  
 Thus, the court below was incorrect in believing 
that Harmelin v. Michigan , 501 U.S. 957 (1991), 
resolves the Eighth Amendment issue presented by 
Evan Miller’s mandatory sentence of life imprison-ment without the possibilit y of parole. Mandatory 
life-without-parole sentencing of children  is different 
from mandatory long-term sentencing of adults  in 
precisely the same way, and for precisely the same 
reason, that Roper  and Graham  held children are 
constitutionally different from adults. What is wrong with mandatory life-without-parole sentencing of chil-
dren is what it removes from the process of propor-
tioning punishment to culpability. It removes any consideration of the specia l features of childhood 
which Roper  and Graham  found constitutionally 
compelling. It flouts Graham ’s instruction that 
“[a]n offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth Amend-
ment, and criminal procedure  laws that fail to take 27 
defendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be 
flawed.” 130 S. Ct. at 2031.33  
 Evan Miller’s case con cretely illustrates this 
failure. His crime was committed under circum-
stances that mirror those which Roper  and Graham  
recognized as prototypical for young adolescents and as diminishing their culpability. Evan was with a 
peer, an older teen. They were sought out at bedtime 
by the victim, an adult, who gave them alcohol and induced them to procure marijuana which he then 
shared with them in his home. An altercation ensued 
for reasons that are unclear. It was initiated when the victim grabbed Evan by the throat. By this time 
Evan was full of intoxic ants, and he responded vio-
lently. He and his companion began beating the vic-tim with a bat. They then set fires in the victim’s 
house. The result was horrible: 52-year-old Cole 
Cannon died of smoke inhalation. There can be no disputing the ugly aspects  of this crime. Under a 
discretionary sentencing procedure, those aspects 
could have been proper for consideration by his sentencer. But the sentence r would also have had to 
ask whether they were explained or mitigated to 
some extent by Evan’s young age and upbringing in a household of abuse, neglect,  and instability, with no 
 
 33 Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in the Graham  judg-
ment, agreed that, in evaluating a sentence of life without parole imposed upon a juvenile, “[t]here is no reason why an offender’s 
juvenile status should be excluded from the analysis,” and, in-deed, an offender’s age should play a “central role.” Id. at 2039.  28 
real nurture and with nothing but the worst of adult 
role models. And the sentencer would also have been 
able to consider Evan’s sincere expression of remorse 
for his participation in the crime, as well as the more lenient sentence received by  his older, equally culpa-
ble co-defendant.
34 
 
 34 A large number of the 79 cases in which children 14 or 
younger were sentenced to life without parole involved older co-
defendants, and in many of these cases – as here and in Kuntrell Jackson’s case – the older co-d efendants receiv ed lesser sen-
tences, despite facts demonstrating that the co-defendant was equally or more culpable. See, e.g. , Hodge v. State , 970 So. 2d 
923, 926 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008) (13-year-old convicted of first degree felon y murder as princi pal but not shooter; court found 
that the jury was convinced by defense argument that defen-dant’s confession, in which he admitted to being the shooter was untrue, yet four co-defendants, including a 17-year-old, were given only ten-year sentences purs uant to second degree murder 
convictions, see http://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/ (search 
DC Numbers: C00385, K71179, K70983, K71014)); State v. 
Tolliver , 639 S.E.2d 673 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007) (14-year-old 
sentenced to LWOP while three 15-year-old co-defendants who were directly involved in robbery-beating death of victim each received 26-32 years); Jordan v. State , 917 S.W.2d 164, 167 
(Ark. 1996) (14-year-old convicted of capital murder and sen-tenced to LWOP while 22-year-o ld co-defendant identified as 
the shooter but sentenced to 50 years;  see http://adc.arkansas. 
gov/visitors/Pages/inmateInformation.aspx (search Cedric Harris, serving LWOP, and Alvis Jordan, not currently incarcerated)); 
Commonwealth v. Olds , 469 A.2d 1072 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1983) (14-
year-old who was outside convenience store when 16-year-old co-defendant Roderick Todd Allen shot and killed store customer sentenced to LWOP while Alle n not convicted of homicide, see 
http://ujsportal.pacourts.us/docketsheets/cp.aspx (search: CP-02-CR-0007206-1979)). 29 
 As it was, none of these factors – mitigating or 
aggravating – entered into the determination of the 
appropriate sentence for Evan and his crime. He was 
simply sent off to prison for life-without-parole as an automatic consequence of his conviction for arson-
murder. Such a judgment cannot be squared with this 
Court’s judgments in Roper  and Graham  that pun-
ishment must constitutionally be proportioned to 
culpability and that the youth and youthful frailties 
of an adolescent offender bear crucially on culpability.
