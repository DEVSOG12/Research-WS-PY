He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a crime he adamantly denied committing at the age of 15.His sentence was vacated after Miller v. Alabama, a Supreme Court decision striking down mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children. Mr. Potts was awaiting resentencing. He was in prison for over 40 years and, if resentenced to life with parole, he would have been immediately eligible for parole release.The lethal violence in Alabama’s prisons is well documented. After a two-year investigation, the Justice Department issued its findings informing Governor Kay Ivey that “[p]risoner-on-prisoner homicide and sexual abuse is common . . . [c]ontraband is rampant. The totality of these conditions pose a substantial risk of serious harm both to prisoners and correctional officers.”The Justice Department informed the governor that the state “routinely violates the constitutional rights of prisoners” by failing to protect them from rampant violence and sexual abuse.Mr. Potts’s death is the third homicide reported in less than a week. Ian Rettig was stabbed to death on May 4 at Fountain Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. This week EJI also received reports that a man who died on February 9 at Donaldson Prison was the victim of a homicide that was not previously reported by the Department of Corrections.EJI received reports that a fourth man, Jerry Purnell, was the victim of suicide in a segregation cell at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville last Friday, May 7.Tags:AlabamaPrison ConditionsRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
