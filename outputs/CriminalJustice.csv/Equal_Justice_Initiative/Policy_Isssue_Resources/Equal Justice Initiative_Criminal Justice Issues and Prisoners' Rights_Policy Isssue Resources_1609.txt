The women at Tutwiler universally fear for their safety. They live in a sexualized environment with repeated and open sexual behavior, including: abusive sexual contact between staff and prisoners; sexualized activity, including a strip show condoned by staff; profane and unprofessional sexualized language and harassment; and deliberate cross-gender viewing of prisoners showering, urinating, and defecating. The inappropriate sexual behavior, including sexual abuse, continues, and is grossly underreported, due to insufficient staffing and supervision, inadequate policies and procedures, a heightened fear of retaliation, and an inadequate investigative process.”Federal investigators conducted an on-site inspection at Tutwiler, interviewed staff and dozens of prisoners, and reviewed documents including incident and investigative reports and letters from about a quarter of the prison population. They found an “unprecedented” amount of corroboration for the women’s reports.The investigation revealed that prison staff have raped, sodomized, fondled, and exposed themselves to prisoners; coerced prisoners to engage in oral sex; engaged in voyeurism, watching women while they shower and use the toilet; and subject women to a “daily barrage of sexually explicit verbal abuse.” Prison officials punish women who report sexual abuse and do not adequately investigate allegations.Because the Alabama Department of Corrections failed to do anything about Tutwiler’s “toxic, sexualized environment that permits staff sexual abuse and harassment” even though they had “repeated notification of the problems,” the investigation concluded that the state violated the Constitution. Officials must take remedial steps or face a federal lawsuit. The required remedies include establishing methods for prisoners to privately report sexual abuse and harassment, protecting women who report, and conducting timely and thorough investigations into alleged abuse.The letter also notified the governor that the Justice Department intends to expand its investigation into Tutwiler, because during its investigation into sexual abuse allegations it found evidence of other constitutional violations, including excessive use of force; inadequate conditions of confinement; inadequate medical and mental health care; and discriminatory treatment based on national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesJustice Department Findings Letter on Tutwiler Prison for WomendocumentRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
