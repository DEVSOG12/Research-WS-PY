Kionne McGhee, Dem-Cutler Bay. “Unacceptable. Unacceptable. And we want answers.”This past summer, Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) inspectors found grime and mold on toilet walls, graffiti in bathroom stalls, and missing tiles in showers. Photos from their inspection show a gaping hole in one wall, exposing plumbing fixtures; widespread graffiti, peeling paint, moldy bathroom floors, caked-on dirt and grime on the concrete slabs where youths sleep, and filthy bathrooms and showers. But not until four days after lawmakers visited the facility was Miami-Dade detention center’s top administrator reprimanded for failing to quickly resolve identified cleanliness and maintenance issues, the Herald reported.At other facilities, lawmakers found youth had numerous untreated ant bites and lice infestations, and had only sporadic access to cold, short showers.Inhumane conditions inside Florida’s juvenile facilities have largely remained hidden from the public. DJJ’s Office of Program Accountability performs oversight of each facility and posts reports online, but those reports do not include any measures of building maintenance, cleanliness, sanitation, plumbing, or ventilation, and such information is not readily available elsewhere.“So many of the children in our detention centers, through no fault of their own, only know impoverishment and deprivation. It is our job, as an institution, to rise above that and show them that their lives are valuable and we expect them to make a positive contribution to our community,” said Miami-Dade Juvenile Court Judge Cindy Lederman, who has spent two decades on the bench. “The conditions in our detention centers only reinforce their impoverishment and deprive them of hope. We should be ashamed. This is not rehabilitation.”Tags:JuvenilesMass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesBusted toilets, peeling paint, sewage backups, lice: a peek inside juvenile lockupsMiami HeraldRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
