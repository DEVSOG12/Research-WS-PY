A state law provision allows sheriffs to take home as personal income money not spent on food. Bartlett pocketed $212,000 over the last three years, while people in his jail went hungry.Evidence presented in federal court by lawyers for the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human Rights, which represents the jail inmates, showed that most of the inmates had lost significant weight. Inmates testified they got half an egg, a spoonful of oatmeal and one piece of toast for breakfast most days, and lunch is usually a handful of chips and two sandwiches with barely enough pea­nut butter to taste.Similar problems exist in many other counties in Alabama. Sheriffs in some 55 of Alabama’s 67 counties pocket as personal income money not spent on food for inmates. The federal judge presiding over the Morgan County case said that this law is “almost an invitation to criminality,” because sheriffs “have a direct pecuniary interest in not feeding inmates.”A court document filed the day after Bartlett’s release from federal custody showed that he has promised in the future to use all government funding he receives for jail food to actually feed prisoners.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesNew York TimesAs His Inmates Grew Thinner, a Sheriffâs Wallet Grew FatterAssociated PressJudge Says Inmates Inadequately Fed By SheriffRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
