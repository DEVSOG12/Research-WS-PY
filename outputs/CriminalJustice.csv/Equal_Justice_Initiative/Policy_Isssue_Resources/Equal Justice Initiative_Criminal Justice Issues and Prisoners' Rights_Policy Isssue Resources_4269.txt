ICE records from that year also indicate that a female detainee tried to hang herself in her cell. The food supply was the subject of a grand jury investigation in 2010.Jurors concluded it was sufficient.The expense of transporting detainees to and from court and lack of access to ICE staff and attorneys were among the reasons why ICE announced it would stop using Etowah in 2010.But ICE pays $40 per detainee daily to the county, adding up to $5 million annually.The federal government also paid the majority of the cost of renovating the jail.Losing that federal money would be a “devastating blow” to the county budget, Etowah Sheriff Todd Entrekin told the Gadsden Times in 2011.Alabama Representatives Robert Aderholt and Mike Rogers and Senators Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions, all Republicans, reacted swiftly, emailing and meeting personally with high-level ICE officials.Rep. Aderholt became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security in January 2011, giving him power to shape ICE’s budget.Gary Mead, ICE’s executive associate director, wrote after meeting with Aderholt, “I do not believe we will be allowed to leave Etowah without serious repercussions against our budget.”Control of the Etowah facility was transferred to ICE’s New Orleans field office.About 100 female detainees once housed at Etowah were moved out and new male detainees were moved in.Many are expected to spend long terms at Etowah.The food quality improved temporarily.But by July, detainees staged a brief hunger strike after complaints that the facility had reverted back to serving food that was rotten and nutritionally inadequate were ignored.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesNBC NewsvideoImmigrant Detainees Land in Limbo in Alabama JailNBC NewsWhen Feds Sought to Shutter Immigration Jail, Politics IntervenedRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
