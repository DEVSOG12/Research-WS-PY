The national average in state prisons is 5.4 homicides per 100,000, making St. Clair a deadly place indeed.• A high rate of stabbings, serious assaults and fights that indicates failure of supervision.• Allegations high-ranking officers engage in violent abuse of inmates, including one case in which a prisoner was punched and badly injured while handcuffed, requiring multiple treatments and surgeries.• Security blunders such as broken locks on cell doors, putting inmates and officers at risk.In April 2014, EJI shared its troubling findings with Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner (ADOC) Kim Thomas and asked him to investigate the escalating violence at St. Clair under the leadership of Warden Carter Davenport. In June 2014, after another prisoner was murdered at St. Clair, EJI renewed its formal request for the immediate removal of Warden Davenport.“We agree Davenport, who has a tainted history of having hit a handcuffed prisoner, should go,” the Advertiser wrote on Monday. “Problems at the top work their way down, and strong new leadership is quickly needed at the prison.”The paper also called for an independent investigation to determine if other officials abetted the climate of violence and should also be removed. “Stronger action is also warranted” to address sexual abuse of inmates and misconduct by officers at Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama.While efforts to end “pervasive and likely illegal overcrowding” in Alabama’s prisons is “commendable,” the editorial board insisted that the violence at St. Clair and in other prisons throughout the state “must be addressed now, not two, five or 10 years down the road.”Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesMontgomery Advertiser EditorialdocumentConfront Prison ViolenceRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
