He was 24 years old. Witnesses report that Mr. Mack was accused of looking at a female officer inappropriately, which prompted an assault by officers that turned into a brutal and vicious murder. Several officers were fired but no criminal charges were filed.On August 8, 2011, EJI called for the immediate criminal prosecution of the Alabama correctional officers who brutally beat Mr. Mack to death. In letters sent to Barbour County District Attorney Ben Reeves and Attorney General Luther Strange, EJI asked the State of Alabama to initiate criminal prosecution against the officers who murdered Mr. Rocrast Mack, and EJI sent a similar letter to the U.S. Department of Justice asking that federal charges be filed against those responsible for the crime.On October 17, the Alabama Attorney General’s office presented evidence to a Barbour County grand jury, which resulted in an indictment charging that then-Lieutenant Michael Smith murdered Rocrast Mack “by beating him with his hands, fists, feet, and/or baton.”“We’re encouraged that criminal charges have been filed for the horrific beating death of Mr. Mack,” said EJI director Bryan Stevenson. “We hope all who are criminally liable are held accountable for this tragedy and that state officials will do as much as possible to eliminate violent assaults and beatings within state prisons.”Tags:AlabamaPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesThe Murder of Rocrast MackEJI's investigation into brutal beating death of Alabama prisoner by prison guards.Birmingham NewsFormer Correctional Officer Arrested in Alabama Prison Inmate's DeathHuffington PostRocrast Mack Murder At Alabama Prison Followed Trail Of Violence By GuardsWashington PostSupercommittee Failed: Legalize Drugs and Save BillionsRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
