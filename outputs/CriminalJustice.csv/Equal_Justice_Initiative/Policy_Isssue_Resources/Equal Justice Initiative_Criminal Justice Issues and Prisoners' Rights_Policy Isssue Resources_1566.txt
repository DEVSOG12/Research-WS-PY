Dr. Austin is nationally recognized for implementing internal classification systems across the country that substantially reduce violence in prisons.An incident management system will also be created to help prison officials prevent, track, and respond to violent incidents. The system will be designed by Ken McGinnis, former chief administrative officer of two of the nation’s largest and most complex correctional systems — Illinois and Michigan– and one of the most highly regarded corrections experts in the country  The Inspector General will oversee the prison’s incident management and all violent incidents will be independtly investigated to increase accountability.The agreement also provides for significant structural reforms. EJI documented serious and chronic lapses in security, including broken and non-functioning locks on the majority of cell doors. Under the agreement, all cell door locks will be replaced, video cameras for monitoring will be installed, several new housing units will be designated to protect incarcerated people with safety needs, and a transitional unit for inmates leaving segregation will be created. The National Institute of Corrections will help analyze issues relating to staff recruitment and retention.“It’s a huge victory for the men and their families who deserve more security than they have seen,” Stevenson said. “It’s exciting that rather than merely hoping the state makes improvements over the next several years while we continue to litigate, we can actually advance remedies immediately.”ADOC agreed to implement two vital new systems that are critical to effective prison management.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesSt. Clair Correctional Facility: Dangerous Conditions and High Rate of Violence Leads to Federal LawsuitRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
