You can’t excuse it. You have to address it.”At a news conference on Friday, Corrections Commissioner Kim Thomas said officials had stopped putting prisoners in solitary confinement for filing a complaint against an officer.Chairman of the state legislature’s prison oversight committee, Republican Senator Cam Ward of Alabaster, said if something is not done to resolve the problems identified at Tutwiler “it would lead to court challenges down the road.”The oversight committee will meet today to address the NIC report.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesNational Institute on Corrections Report on Tutwiler Prison for WomendocumentFox 6 WBRC NewsFederal Report has New Details of Abuse at Tutwiler Prison for WomenAL.comAlabama Lawmakers to Hold Meeting on Sexual Abuse at Tutwiler PrisonWSFA EditorialWrong Is WrongRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
