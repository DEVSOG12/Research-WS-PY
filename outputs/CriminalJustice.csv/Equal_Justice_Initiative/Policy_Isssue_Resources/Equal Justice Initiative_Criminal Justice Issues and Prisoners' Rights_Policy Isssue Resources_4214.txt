The bill would improve conditions for some 12,695 women in federal prisons but the vast majority of women are held in state prisons and local jails, where abuse and mistreatment often goes unchecked.Menstrual supplies are used as tools of control in jails and prisons, with officers sometimes limiting access to teach women a lesson. As the authors of a recent New York Times op-ed put it:In correction facilities across the country, from county jails to federal penitentiaries, the varied ways in which menstruating prisoners are disregarded or disrespected is staggering. When access to basic hygiene supplies is withheld, it is often the direct result of an abusive culture – one that many facilities tolerate and few laws can adequately address.Most incarcerated women are mothers, and many have histories of drug use, sexual and physical abuse, and mental health problems. More than 70 percent were living in poverty prior to being incarcerated. The mass incarceration of women in America is a critical problem that requires sentencing reforms as well as changes in prison policies. Women in prison are “in need of therapy, in need of healing, and in need of support,” Senator Booker said, calling the criminal justice system profoundly unjust.Advocates hope the bill will encourage state and local officials to follow suit. “We need to create a prison that, yes, is holding people accountable, and yes, is allowing people to pay their debt to society for mistakes they have made, but also is about the dignity of humanity,” Senator Booker said. “We’ve got to be a better society than this.”Tags:Mass IncarcerationPovertyPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesFor Women in Prison, Tampons Should Be FreeNew York Times Op-EdCory Booker And Elizabeth Warren Want To Treat Women In Prison Like Human BeingsHuffington PostRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
