Crowding and staffing shortages, and corrections officers’ failure to protect inmates from staff and fellow inmates, contribute to the escalating violence.The Alabama Department of Corrections is looking into Mr. Newell’s death itself; the Alabama Bureau of Investigation may also investigate.After correctional officers beat to death handcuffed prisoner Rocrast Mack at Ventress Correctional Facility in Clayton, Alabama, in August 2010, it took more than a year and a federal investigation before, in March 2012, FBI agents arrested three former guards.Questions about the safety and security of Alabama prisons are being directed at Alabama corrections officials, who have said very little about this most recent murder.Last month legislators convened a special hearing to inquire about reports of increased violence.The department recently acknowledged the need for an external audit after EJI reported widespread sexual violence against women at Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesBirmingham NewsAlabama Prison Violence Rising in Overcrowded System, 6/3/12Associated PressdocumentReport: Violence Increasing in Crowded Alabama Prisons as Budget Cuts Loom, 6/3/12Birmingham NewsAlabama's Bullock Mental Health Facility the Most Violent Prison in State, 6/3/12Recent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
