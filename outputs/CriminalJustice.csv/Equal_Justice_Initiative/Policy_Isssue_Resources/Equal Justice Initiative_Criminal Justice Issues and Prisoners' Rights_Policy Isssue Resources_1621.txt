Tens of thousands of consumers have been “pleading for relief on interstate long distance rates from correctional facilities,” according to an FCC statement on December 28, 2012.“This is not just an issue of markets and rates; it is a broader issue of social justice,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. “When a single phone call may cost as much as a month of unlimited phone service, the financial burden of staying in touch may be too much for inmates’ families to bear.”“The telephone is a crucial instrument for the incarcerated, and those who care about them, because voice calling is often the only communications option available,” FCC Commissioner Mignon L. Clyburn said in a statement. “Most inmates along with their families and friends are low-income, so in-person visits due to distance and expense are infrequent.”“Maintaining contact with family and friends during incarceration not only helps the inmate, but it is beneficial to our society as a whole,” Commissioner Clyburn explained, by reducing the likelihood that those released will reoffend.Two companies – Global Tel*Link Corp. and Securus Technologies, Inc., make up 80% of the prison phone market. Rates are set by contracts between these companies and state and local governments, who often receive “commissions” or kickbacks for each prison site. As a result, family members in some states can pay as much as $15 for a 15-minute phone call.The FCC is currently seeking public opinion over a 60-day period concerning its proposal.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPovertyPrison ConditionsRe-EntryRelated ResourcesFCC: Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling ServicesLos Angeles TimesFCC Proposes Changes to Lower Pay-Phone Rates for PrisonersRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
