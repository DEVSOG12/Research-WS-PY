Five years ago, I embarked on a journey to learn my ancestral language as an adult. This journey has been difficult due to the disappearance of the K’iche’ language in the second generation of my family. My grandmother’s first mother tongue was K’iche’, and while my mother is able to understand it, she is unable to speak it. I am unable to understand or speak the language.A Precious Feather of the Native-Speaking BirdReclaiming the Forgotten Khoikhoi Language in South AfricaKakapusa, (erasure, or amnesia) in the Khoikhoi language, defines our Khoi reality in South Africa, a nameless country. No other group has experienced such violent systemic erasure on our own lands and with quite such intensity as our Khoi Peoples. It is frightening at times, given that 40 percent of this country is called “the Karoo,” which in Khoikhoi means “dry place.” Indeed, the Karoo is an arid place.

Some historians say that the Indigenous Peoples themselves, mainly Guarani and Tupi-speaking, created this language. Others say that it was a language created in partnership between the Tupinikin and Guarani Peoples and the Jesuit priests.Legal Frameworks to Protect Indigenous LanguagesThe following is an excerpt of Dr. Wilton Littlechild’s (Cree) keynote address at the “Restoring and Protecting Our Native Languages and Landscapes” Conference.He Hulu Manu ʻŌlelo ʻŌiwi: Ke Anahulu Makahi ʻŌlelo ʻŌiwi 2022-2032Me he manu e pūʻā ana i ka ʻai mai kona waha e hānai ai i kāna keiki, pēia e hānai ʻia ai ka ʻōlelo ʻōiwi mai ka waha mākua a i ka waha hanauna hou.  A ma ka piʻi ʻana o ka mahina ʻo Mauli ma ke anahulu ʻo Hōʻemi ma ka malama ʻo Mahoehope a i ka iho ʻana o ka mahina ʻo Hilo ma ke anahulu ʻo Hoʻonui ma ka malama ʻo ʻIkuwā ua lālā aku ke kumu lāʻau i kanu ʻia he mau anahulu makahiki i hala iho nei e ka ʻohana Cultural Survival.  A he kumulāʻau heahea manu ʻōiwi ia a ua pane ʻia ua kāhea aloha.  Ma o ka ʻenehana ua ʻākoakoa mai nā lālā manu ʻōlelo ʻōiwi like ʻole mai kēlā kihi kēia kihi o ka hOur Itelmen Language Cannot Be Separated From Our LandThis is a story about an ancient language that resides on the Kamchatka peninsula on the Pacific coast of Russia.
