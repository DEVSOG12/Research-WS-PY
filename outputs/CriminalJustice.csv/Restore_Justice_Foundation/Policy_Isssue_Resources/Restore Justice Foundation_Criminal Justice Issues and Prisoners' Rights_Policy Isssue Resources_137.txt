Their cases were heard entirely in adult criminal courts. Prosecutors may also request discretionary transfers for another set of crimes.Once in adult court, adult sentencing laws apply.SENTENCING LAWSIn some circumstances, life without the possibility of parole was mandatory for individuals convicted of murder when they were under the age of 18. Specific cases include the murder of a police officer or multiple homicides.  In other circumstances, a life sentence is discretionary. These cases may involve exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior or other factors.Before the Supreme Court’s Miller decision, approximately 80% of individuals who were serving life without parole sentences for crimes committed when they were children received mandatory sentences.  Otherwise, a conviction for first-degree murder carries a sentence of 20 to 100 years.Once in adult court, adult sentencing laws apply.ACCOUNTABILITY THEORYIllinois has a particularly strict accountability statute.  A child who aids, attempts to aid, or agrees to aid someone else in committing a crime that leads to a murder, such as robbery or burglary, must be found guilty of murder even if the child did not pull the trigger or hit the victim and even if the child was not present at the murder scene.This law is particularly unjust given the scientific evidence showing children’s susceptibility to peer pressure.We don’t know how many individuals serving life without parole sentences for crimes committed when they were children were convicted based on a theory of accountability because Illinois’s criminal legal systems do not maintain adequate data.TRUTH IN SENTENCING LAWSBefore the mid-1990s, prisoners generally had the opportunity to earn “good time” credits and other credit for good behavior that allowed them to be released early—often halving the time of their sentences.  These policies promoted rehabilitation and helped states manage the prison population. But a rising crime rate in the late 1980s led to a wave of laws known as truth-in-sentencing that limited the basis for early release.Illinois passed a truth-in-sentencing law in 1998, severely restricting the opportunity for early release.Now in Illinois, anyone convicted of first-degree murder must serve 100% of the sentence imposed.  For most other serious crimes, an individual must serve at least 85% of his or her sentence and is only granted sentence credit at the discretion of the Department of Corrections.Citation1. Illinois Public Act 099-0258Mailing Address: Restore Justice FoundationPO Box 101099Chicago, IL 60610Follow UsSubscribe:First NameLast NameEmail address:Street AddressCityStateZIPCountryCountryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Saint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCook IslandsCosta RicaCroatiaCubaCuracaoCyprusCzech RepublicDemocratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEast TimorEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyIvory CoastJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian TerritoryPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of the CongoReunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthelemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluU.S. Virgin IslandsUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVaticanVenezuelaVietnamWallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweLeave this field empty if you're human:Δ© 2020 Restore Justice & Restore Justice Illinois.
