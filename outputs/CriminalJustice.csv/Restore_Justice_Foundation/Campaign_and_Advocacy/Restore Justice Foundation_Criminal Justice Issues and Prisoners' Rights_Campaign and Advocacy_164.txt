This is the first legislative reaction to the August “Lake County Five” case. In that case, five Chicago teenagers were charged with first-degree murder after a homeowner shot and killed a sixth teenager while the youth were attempting to steal an automobile.Illinois has one of the broadest felony-murder statutes in thecountry. The law allows a person to be charged and convicted of first-degreemurder even if they did not kill or intend to kill anyone. A felony-murderconviction carries a minimum sentence of 20 years and a possible maximumsentence of natural life.HB1615, sponsored by Chairman Slaughter, would amend the law to:Ensure individuals who do not personally inflictor plan to inflict an injury during the course of a felony will not be chargedwith first-degree murder; and, Ensure someone is truly culpable for murder ifthey are to be given our state’s harshest possible punishment.Senator Robert Peters has filed identical legislation in the Senate,SB2292.On Wednesday, peopledirectly affected by the felony-murder rule will share their stories.Youthful offenders are disproportionately burdened by the currentfelony-murder rule, as they are more likely to act in groups and are moresusceptible to peer pressure. The part of the brain that assesses risk is amongthe last to form.In the Lake County case, prosecutors charged the teenagers with themurder of their own family member and friend—despite none of them having pulledthe trigger. While we’re grateful the charges were dropped, it’s time to makesure this part of the law can’t be used to overcharge others.When children or young adults are charged with felony-murder, they are branded “violent offenders” for life and are subject to adult court, adult prison sentences, and the same sentencing range as the person who “pulled the trigger.” Once convicted, these people have no ability to demonstrate rehabilitation and seek shorter sentences. Research has proven long sentences don’t deter crime. They don’t make our communities safer.Supporters of HB1615ACLU of IllinoisCabrini Green Legal AidChicago Appleseed Fund for JusticeChicago Coalition for the HomelessChicago Community Bond FundChicago Urban LeagueChicago Council of LawyersJohn Howard AssociationJustice Advisory CouncilLaw Office of the Cook County Public DefenderLeague of Women Voters of IllinoisMoms United Against Violence & IncarcerationPrecious Blood Ministry of ReconciliationRestore Justice IllinoisShriver Center on Poverty LawTreatment Alternatives for Safe CommunitiesUnitarian Universalist Advocacy Network of IllinoisUnitarian Universalist Prison Ministry of IllinoisWomen’s Justice Institute###Restore Justice advocates for fairness, humanity, and compassion throughout the Illinois criminal justice system, with a primary focus on those affected by extreme sentences imposed on our youth.  We create and support policies that allow those who are rehabilitated to go home, and that ensure those incarcerated, their families, and victim families have opportunities for healing and justice.

He wss present when his brother committed a murder. He didn’t know that this would happen. He received the same sentence his brother did. He has no criminal history before this happened. He was 21 at the time. His brother told him if he snitched the same thing would happen to him. But he couldn’t live with what happened and went to the local police and told them what happened. He may not have been completely truthful the first time they questioned him but he did eventually. I have read the court documents and there are inconsistencies in the eyewitness account of what happened. He has served 14 of the 45yrs of his sentence. How do I go about finding help for him?Post A Comment Cancel ReplyΔMailing Address: Restore Justice FoundationPO Box 101099Chicago, IL 60610Follow UsSubscribe:First NameLast NameEmail address:Street AddressCityStateZIPCountryCountryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Saint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCook IslandsCosta RicaCroatiaCubaCuracaoCyprusCzech RepublicDemocratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEast TimorEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyIvory CoastJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian TerritoryPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of the CongoReunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthelemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluU.S. Virgin IslandsUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVaticanVenezuelaVietnamWallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweLeave this field empty if you're human:Δ© 2020 Restore Justice & Restore Justice Illinois.
