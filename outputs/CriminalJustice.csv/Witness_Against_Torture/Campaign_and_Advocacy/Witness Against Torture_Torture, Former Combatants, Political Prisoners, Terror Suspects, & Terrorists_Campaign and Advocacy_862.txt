fast in solidarity; write the president and all his advisors; call our Congresspeople; write letters to the men; remind our fellow citizens that our government tortures and detains Muslim men indefinitely.We repeat ourselves because we must, so here you see the local DC/MD/VA folks calling out President Biden on April 2 with the same banner we carried this year on January 11.  Same-day stories about the repatriation of Sufiyan Barhoumi to Algeria featured this WAT vigil (links below).This newsletter opens with an exciting new project -- launched this Ramadan -- to raise money to meet the needs of former detainees, many of whom are exiled in third countries.  Then come stories about the three men Biden has "transferred" and one who died after being released, Maha's exciting new initiative, commentary on right-wing Guantanamo propaganda at Jackson-Brown's Senate hearing, and opportunities for action.Watch for the fund-raising campaign for former detainees next week!In peace and solidarity,WAT Organizing TeamExciting new initiative: the Guantanamo Survivors FundThe Guantanamo Survivors Fund has been created to raise and disseminate funds to former Guantanamo prisoners.  Often exiled to third countries, many still suffer from the physical and mental effects of what they endured in Guantánamo and experience social isolation and economic hardship because they have been labeled terrorists who require government monitoring.  One third have no legal status  in the countries to which they were exiled.  A year ago, Lutfi bin Ali died from untreated complications of heart disease after being transferred first to Kazakhstan, then to Mauritania, where he was unable to obtain appropriate medical care.Initiated by WAT, No More Guantanamos, and others, the fund will provide resources for explicit needs such as medical care, education and training, and basic living needs to the extent possible.  Watch for an email next week for the first fundraising campaign, which will last through Ramadan.Three detainees transferred on Biden's watchThe number 3 is nothing to brag about, but it's a start.  On Saturday, April 2, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Sufiyan Barhoumi to his native Algeria.  That day a dozen WAT folks happened to be witnessing in front of the White House, so it's their picture you see at the top of several of the stories about Barhoumi's release.  Ironically, WAT was calling out the U.S. war crime that is Guantanamo alongside a rally decrying Russia's war crime in Ukraine.Abdul Latif Nasser, who was repatriated to Morocco in July, 2021, was Biden's first transfer.  The second and most tragic release was that of Mohammad al-Qahtani to Saudi Arabia in March, 2022 to "receive appropriate mental health care in a rehabilitation facility."  Labeled the "20th hijacker," al-Qahtani was determined to be too mentally ill to stand trial. He was tortured in Guantanamo in 2002-03.Dr. Maha Hilal creates the Muslim Counterpublics LabDr. Hilal co-founded the Justice for Muslims Collective (JMC) in 2016 to mount a robust response to Islamophobia in the War on Terror.  JMC's highly successful multi-pronged program outgrew its original structure and two new organizations, each with a more explicit focus, have been created.Dr. Hilal has launched the Muslim Counterpublics Lab to develop political consciousness and narrative shifting for addressing institutionalized Islamophobia and state violence, through advocacy and organizing on issues such as the closure of Guantanamo Bay prison, an end to torture, surveillance, and accountability for war crimes.  MCL is a radical discursive space focused on combatting systems of oppression rooted in Islamophobia through advocacy, research, writing, organizing, and victim-centered support.Right-wing opportunists spew Guantánamo propaganda at Ketanje Brown-Jackson hearingsThe Senate hearing laid bare the vicious tropes Republicans used to promote the false label of terrorist they hang around the necks of the Muslim men brought to Guantánamo.  Maha Hilal strikes back in Common Dreams.Government wants "plea deals" after 10 years of failed Military Commissions "trials"The prosecution in the September 11 case has entered into plea negotiations with the legal teams for the five defendants accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. The government would take the death penalty off the table in exchange for guilty pleas to war crimes, multiple sources with knowledge of the talks said this week.  more....Keep the pressure on BidenThree key people need to hear from you every month, urging President Biden to close Guantanamo: President Biden, his Secretary of State Anthony Blinken (Secretary@state.gov,  ishttps://twitter.com/SecBlinken), and State Department official John Godfrey (godfreyjt@state.gov).  Write them in your own words!Write to a man in GuantanamoAndy Worthington has renewed his call for letters of support to the men imprisoned in Guantanamo.

They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2022 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
