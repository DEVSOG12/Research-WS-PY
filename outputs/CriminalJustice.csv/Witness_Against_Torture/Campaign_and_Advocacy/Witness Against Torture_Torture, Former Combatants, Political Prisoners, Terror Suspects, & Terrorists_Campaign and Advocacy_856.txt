You were tortured and abused. You could not see your family. Your only visitors were interrogators and lawyers. And then you were cleared for release — deemed by your captors to be no threat — and told that the prison would close. But you remained locked up, with no end in sight. Who would hear your cries? What resistance could you mount?This is the situation for dozens of men at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo. Fed up with their treatment and spurred by a new wave of abuses, they launched a hunger strike in February that is just now gaining attention in the U.S. press.

Lawyers for prisoners say the men are protesting their indefinite confinement and what they consider intrusive searches of their Qurans. The U.S. government now admits that 21 men are refusing food, though the attorneys insist the number is much higher.The health of those on hunger strike is deteriorating. Attorneys report that some men have lost 20-30 pounds and that at least two dozen have lost consciousness. According to medical experts, irreversible mental and physiological damage such as hearing loss, blindness, and hemorrhaging may begin to occur by the fortieth day of a hunger strike, and death follows thereafter.The U.S. Navy reports that 8 men are being force-fed — a practice condemned by some human rights organizations as itself a form of torture, and used in efforts to “break” prior hunger strikes at Guantanamo.166 men remain imprisoned at Guantanamo. 86 have been cleared for release. All are being subject to indefinite detention, held at the cost of $800,000 per year for each man, at a prison the President of the United States pledged to close on his first day of office in January 2009.[/peekaboo_content]More Info About the Hunger Strike“We Have Not Forgotten Your Suffering” – Common Dreams (3-25-13)More Join Hunger Strike at Guantánamo Prison – New York Times (3-25-13)Food Fight: Guantánamo Captives, guards at stalemate – The Miami Herald (3-24-13)Number of Hunger Strikers Surges at Guantánamo – New York Times (3-20-13)Guantánamo hunger strike grows – The Miami Herald (3-19-13)How Long Can the Government Pretend that the Massive Hunger Strike at Guantánamo Doesn’t Exist? – Andy Worthington (3-17-13)Attorney Letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel – Center for Constitutional Rights (3-14-13)Guantanamo: By the Numbers – Center for Constitutional Rights (3-11-13)***Witness Against Torture formed in 2005 when 25 Americans went to Guantánamo Bay to protest the detention facility.
