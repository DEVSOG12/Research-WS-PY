Circuit last year.20 Years and No Good Malay Translators?The trial of two Malaysians facing terrorism charges, scheduled for Feb 28 in Guantanamo Prison, has been postponed “until the US government finds qualified Malay translators”, according to the lawyer of one of the accused.  The US government has known for two decades now that Nazir doesn’t speak English.  “In fact, he was tortured by people too stupid to realise that screaming at someone in English doesn’t work if the person doesn’t understand the language being used."Donate to Witness Against Torture & Help us Keep the Pressure on Biden Close Guantanamo!Donate HereDonate to support our workPlease consider a donation to help fund our annual Fast for Justice this January.  We are completely volunteer-driven and run.

They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2022 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
