President Barack Obama is coming to the end of his term and Guantanamo is again in the public discourse. Thanks to your support and efforts over the last 10 years, we remain steadfast in our work calling for a worldwide end to torture with a focus on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center.There is much organizing to be done – phone calls to make, street speaking and rabble rousing to do, flyers to distribute, and actions to plan. We are preparing powerful and creative actions to pressure President Obama to fulfill his promise to close Guantanamo before he leaves office. However, we cannot do this without your support. Therefore, we are launching an effort to raise the money needed for this work. Please check out this video to learn more.(Click on image to view video)The next months are important ones to pressure the administration to take decisive action to close the prison and release the men. However, the administration seeems to be forming plans – which we strongly oppose – to move the men in Guantanamo to specialized military prisons in the United States. We also hope to continue to set Guantanamo within the framework of the vibrant, nascent movement against police brutality, white supremacy and the prison industrial complex in the United States. Moving Guantanamo is not closing it.We are very grateful for the support of generous donors, like you, who enable us to continue the work. We have much more to do in the coming months to close Guantanamo and expose torture both here and abroad. You can be a part of this effort by making a donation on our fundraising page, following us on Facebook and Twitter and sharing our fundraising efforts on your social media pages.Witness Against Torture is a grassroots, volunteer-based collective with no paid stafff but do have expenses associated with our organizing work — so we need your financial support. Your donations are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, the Washington Peace Center. With your support, we will carry on in our activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantanamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.Thank you,Witness Against TortureJoin us on social mediaPosted on November 17, 2015Author Chris KnestrickCategories NewsJoin UsNewsPhotosVideosEventsPrisonersResourcesAboutStoreFacebook
