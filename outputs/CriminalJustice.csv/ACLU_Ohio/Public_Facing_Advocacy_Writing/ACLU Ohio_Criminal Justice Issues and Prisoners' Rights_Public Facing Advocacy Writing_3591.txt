The revised ordinance further states that no one is allowed to knowingly touch or grab another person or their property without their consent.The ACLU of Ohio sued the County earlier this year, challenging the constitutionality of the now-repealed anti-panhandling ordinance. As part of the settlement, the County agreed to pay damages to the ACLU’s client, Mr. Wilson, as well as attorney’s fees and costs.“The County’s laws now reflect the constitutional reality that panhandling is completely legal,” said ACLU of Ohio Staff Attorney Elizabeth Bonham. “We hope this settlement sends a message to counties and cities across Ohio: government entities cannot silence people whose only ‘crime’ is to ask for money.”This latest policy change is Summit County’s third attempt to regulate panhandling. In December of 2018, County Council repealed a 2013 anti-panhandling ordinance as a result of an ACLU study identifying existing unconstitutional ordinances in Ohio and urging cities and counties to repeal said laws.“Shortly after repealing the 2013 law, Summit County Council introduced a new law, disguised some of the language, but continued to criminalize panhandling anyways,” added Joe Mead, cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Ohio. “We are glad that version 2.0 has now been repealed as an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment.”###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
