Today’s letter expands upon the asks made in a letter sent March 27, where the ACLU of Ohio and others outlined Ohio laws and the various executive powers the Governor has to reduce Ohio’s incarcerated populations.“The safety of those incarcerated and prison staff demand our leaders act quickly and are equipped with proper knowledge to most effectively combat the COVID-19 crisis. Our prison system currently operates about 10,000 people above capacity. We call on Governor DeWine to heed our advice and immediately reduce prison populations to ensure the safety and health of Ohioans behind bars. This situation could turn bleak in a moment’s notice and we must be prepared for rapid decarceration to prevent matters getting far worse,” added Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio.The ACLU of Ohio asks the Governor to consider the following categories when determining where to make prison reductions: people with health vulnerabilities, people over the age of 60, people with six months or less remaining on their sentence, people with technical violations, people serving for drug possession, non-violent offenders, and people in prison for F4 and F5 offenses.“We feel compelled to offer as much detail as possible; however, our requests are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather to demonstrate that meaningful avenues exist to significantly and safely depopulate our bursting prison system now subjected to unprecedented risk,” concluded Daniels.A copy of the letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfDeWine-letter-DRCreduction-04.01.20.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
