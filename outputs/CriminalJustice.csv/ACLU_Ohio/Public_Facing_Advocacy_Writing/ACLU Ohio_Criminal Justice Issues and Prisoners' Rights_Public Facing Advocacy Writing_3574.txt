As of May 1, staff at Morrow announced that at least 50 of the detainees had tested positive for COVID-19, and their conditions range from asymptomatic to unable to move.“As public health experts forewarned, the Morrow County Jail has become an infected, dangerous place to be. There is no way to make this facility safe. Our clients can and should be moved out where they can safely isolate or quarantine, as required, and where they can access care," noted ACLU of Ohio Staff Attorney Elizabeth Bonham."Each of our clients is confined in a hotbed of infection from which they cannot escape.  We are deeply concerned that we’re going to start seeing preventable deaths at Morrow Jail," added Claire Chevrier, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of Ohio.Every single new plaintiff is in a high-risk category that puts them at greater risk for severe illness and all have tested positive for COVID-19, or will imminently, as they are confined to pods with many other individuals who’ve tested positive and are at different stages of the virus. The ACLU of Ohio argues that release is the only viable remedy to ensure their safety during this pandemic.The ACLU of Ohio has successfully released eight ICE detainees from legal filings in Butler, Geauga, Morrow, and Seneca Counties.A copy of the complaint is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdf2020-05-05-014-Amended-Complaint-and-Petition.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
