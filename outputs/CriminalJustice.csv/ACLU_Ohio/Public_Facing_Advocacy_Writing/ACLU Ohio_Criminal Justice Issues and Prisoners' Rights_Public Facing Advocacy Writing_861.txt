Advance Bail Reform and Support SB 182 | American Civil Liberties UnionSkip to main contentACLU of OhioAdvance Bail Reform and Support SB 182We know that cash bail creates a two-tiered system of justice in which people who can afford their freedom go home to their families, and those who cannot are forced to suffer in jail. On any given day in Ohio, there are as many as 12,000 people held pretrial.Senate Bill 182:Guarantees everyone who is arrested will receive an initial release decision within 24 hours.Ensures everyone who doesn’t pose a risk of willful flight or to the safety of any person will be able to return to their homes and communities.Requires those who may pose a risk of willful flight or to the safety of any person receive a hearing before a judge within 48 hours for most offenses.Stipulates that if money bail is set, judges must make written findings on the record about its necessity and the person’s ability to pay.TAKE ACTION and tell the Senate Judiciary Committee to support, advance, and eventually vote YES on SB 182. Ohio needs #BailReformNow.Message Recipients:Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee[The Form Label field is hidden on ACLU message action forms]Your MessageSubjectDear Members of the Senate Judiciary CommitteeIt's time to advance SB 182 to the full Senate. This bill, to reform Ohio’s pretrial justice system, will make our state safer and more equitable.Message BodyOhioans overwhelmingly support bail reform. A new public opinion poll conducted by The Tarrance Group revealed that 75% of Ohio voters believe that Ohio’s criminal justice system is in need of reform, and 70% believe in reforming cash bail so we can ensure each and every Ohioan is treated fairly, regardless of skin color and ability to pay.Not only is bail reform popular, it’s also hugely cost-effective. A report issued in September of 2020 illustrates how common-sense bail reform policies could save Ohio up to $264 million annually. Jailing thousands of pretrial defendants on any given day is incredibly expensive. Wealth should never determine one’s freedom.It is abundantly clear that the status quo is not effective or acceptable. It’s time to meaningful change our pretrial justice system for the better. It’s time for #BailReformNow.Thank you, again, for your commitment to ensuring Ohio is a place of freedom and justice for all by supporting and advancing SB 182.With gratitude,[First Name] [Last Name]Your InformationAll data you enter here will be shared with the message recipient along with your message, per our privacy statement.Salutation *- Select -Mr.Mrs.MsMissDr.Mx.(required by some officials)ABOUT HONORIFIC TITLESMany public officials use "web mail forms" that this system will send your message to, so you don't have to visit their web sites to communicate with them.
