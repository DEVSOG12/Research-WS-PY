As of April 28, there have been 3,884 positive infections and 25 deaths in ODRC facilities.The ACLU of Ohio is seeking:Any and all records containing recommendations, proposals, calculations, forecasts, plans, and procedures, currently in use and not in use, for:Accomplishing social distancingReducing Ohio’s prison population, related to COVID-19 concernsReducing Ohio’s prison population, related to COVID-19 concerns, using executive, legal or statutory methods and powersAny and all records containing information regarding the reentry of individuals released from Ohio prisons back into their community.Specifically, broad plans, recommendations, proposals, calculations, and best practices as well as, correspondence with state and local reentry groups, organizations, and professionals.Any and all records sent or received regarding the formal deployment of the Ohio National Guard in any Ohio prison and FCI Elkton.Specifically, information about the Ohio National Guard’s duties, mandates, and restrictions (if any) on duties performed in the Ohio prison context.“Public health experts have rung multiple alarm bells about the spread of COVID-19 in our prison system. Despite those warnings, the decarceration of jails, prisons, and other detention facilities continues much too slowly to avoid catastrophe, noted Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio. “The ACLU of Ohio seeks greater understanding regarding Ohio’s response to COVID-19 and mass incarceration, including actions taken – and not taken - by Governor DeWine.”“We warned Governor DeWine that COVID-19 would spread like wildfire behind bars, and it is. Marion Correctional Institution is reported to have the largest number of positive cases in the entire United States. Despite this information, Governor DeWine has only released about 1% of Ohio’s total prison population, which is already over capacity by over 10,000 people. These requests will allow us to see the bigger picture,” concluded Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director for the ACLU of Ohio.Read the public record's request.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfRecReq-DeWine-COVID-19-04.29.20.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
