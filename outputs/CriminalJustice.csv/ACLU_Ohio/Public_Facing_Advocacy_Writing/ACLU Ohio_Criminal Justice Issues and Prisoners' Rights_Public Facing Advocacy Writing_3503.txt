TAKE ACTION TO ABOLISH OHIO’S DEATH PENALTY | American Civil Liberties UnionSkip to main contentACLU of OhioTAKE ACTION TO ABOLISH OHIO’S DEATH PENALTYTake ActionIn February, a team of bipartisan lawmakers in both the House and the Senate introduced companion legislation to abolish Ohio’s death penalty. We strongly support this effort and are eager to see the bills advance through the committee process.Capital punishment is inequitable, inhumane, and ineffective. It has far more to do with geography, money, and race than anything resembling justice. States across the country are backing away from it. Ohio should be next.TAKE ACTION: Tell the Senate Judiciary Committee to support, advance, and eventually vote YES on SB 103. Let’s abolish the death penalty once and for all.Message Recipients:Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee[The Form Label field is hidden on ACLU message action forms]Your MessageSubjectDear State Senators,Thank you for holding a proponent testimony on SB 103, legislation to abolish Ohio’s death penalty.Message BodyCurrently, 23 states plus Washington D.C. have cut ties with the death penalty, Ohio can and should be the next.The death penalty is at least three times more expensive than other sentencing options. It is estimated that death penalty trials cost Ohio taxpayers as much as $16 million dollars per case.In addition to being costly and arbitrary, the death penalty is also unpopular among Ohioans. A statewide opinion poll conducted by The Tarrance Group in October 2020, revealed that 59% of Ohioans support replacing the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole. Furthermore, Ohio is already functioning with an unofficial moratorium on executions – it’s time to make the temporary moratorium permanent.Capital punishment is inequitable, inhumane, and ineffective. Please support and advance SB 103 to abolish Ohio’s death penalty.Sincerely,[First Name] [Last Name]Your InformationAll data you enter here will be shared with the message recipient along with your message, per our privacy statement.Salutation *- Select -Mr.Mrs.MsMissDr.Mx.(required by some officials)ABOUT HONORIFIC TITLESMany public officials use "web mail forms" that this system will send your message to, so you don't have to visit their web sites to communicate with them.
