This is the second time in less than two weeks that the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block an order that would protect prisoners from COVID-19. The Supreme Court rejected the first request last week, but the Government has now asked again for a stay.The government’s request comes as COVID is spiking at Elkton. At latest count, 461 prisoners have tested positive and are currently infected, and another 112 have previously been infected. That’s one of every four people incarcerated. Nine people have died, including two in the class of vulnerable individuals that the federal court order seeks to protect.US District Court Judge James Gwin has ordered that the prison’s 837 members of the medically vulnerable subclass be removed from harm’s way, by transferring them to other facilities or home confinement. The government has yet to move a single prisoner, despite being under an injunction to do so as of April 22. Elkton is one of the two most infected federal prisons in the nation.David Cole, legal director of the ACLU, issued the following statement:"The fact that the administration has gone back to the court to once again ask it to block an order that will save lives at Elkton is egregious and dangerous. One in every five people incarcerated at Elkton prison currently has tested positive for COVID-19, and we suspect the actual number is even higher due to testing issues. Unless swift action is taken to remove vulnerable prisoners from Elkton, we are going to see more people get sick and die. This is predictable, preventable, and the Trump administration will be to blame for doing everything in its power to slow down — if not block entirely — this life-saving order."David Carey, senior staff attorney of the ACLU of Ohio, issued the following statement:“It’s been over a month since Judge Gwin ordered Elkton to start using every means at its disposal to move medically-vulnerable prisoners to safety. Instead of complying, the federal government has stalled and delayed at every turn. The Supreme Court just denied their motion for stay last week, and the federal government is back yet again. Even though the prison is still failing to conduct adequate testing, we know for certain that nine people have died, and this deadly outbreak is continuing to worsen. If the Supreme Court issues a stay, halting the lower court’s efforts to force expedited release and transfer of those who remain at high risk, the outcome will be devastating.”A copy of the brief is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfNo-19A1047_Williams-v-Wilson_Opposition-to-Application-to-Stay-Injunction-and-Appendix-.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
