The settlement came as a response to the DOJ investigation of the 2012 shooting deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams and its subsequent findings on Cleveland Police Department practices, in particular its excessive use of force on people of color.“This is a step forward, but this is truly only the beginning,” said Christine Link, executive director of the ACLU of Ohio. “To change the culture of the police force, which has been engaged in unfair and unjust treatment of people of color for so long, will not happen overnight. It will take a strong and vibrant partnership with community members based on respect and trust, as well as the resolve of officials to not allow discrimination and unconstitutional practices fester within the Cleveland Police Department any longer."The ACLU of Ohio had previously made recommendations to the DOJ and city officials on policies it should include in the consent decree, many of which are present in the final agreement. In addition to robust community involvement, other ACLU recommendations that are present include: better data collection; increased transparency; strengthened accountability through civilian review boards and an inspector general; addressing discriminatory policing; preventing unconstitutional stop, searches and seizures; assessing equipment needs of law enforcement officers; and long term oversight of the department.The ACLU will continue to work with U.S. Department of Justice, community groups, and the government to move toward a police department that is fair, restrained and committed to protecting the lives of all people. The ACLU’s goal is to help build community-police partnerships with the shared goals of equality, fairness, and justice to ensure public safety.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesPolice PracticesRacial JusticeDocumentspdfDOJ-ClevelandConsentDecree2015_0526.pdfRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022As if COVID Wasn’t Enough: A Continuous Assault on Student’s Rights...April 30, 2022Ahead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022House Bill 607 - Opponent TestimonyApril 6, 2022House Joint Resolution 2 - Opponent TestimonyApril 6, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
