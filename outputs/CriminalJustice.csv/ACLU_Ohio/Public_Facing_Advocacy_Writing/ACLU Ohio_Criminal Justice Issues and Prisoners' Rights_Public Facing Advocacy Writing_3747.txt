Your meals are eaten inside this room, and there is limited reading and television access.This is solitary confinement in Ohio.Persons With Mental Illness in SolitaryNow imagine you have a mental illness. Make no mistake, you can still be subjected to solitary confinement.Too few community mental health resources make it likely that people with a mental illness will find their way to prison where there are even fewer resources. About 80 percent of those incarcerated in Ohio’s prisons have a documented history of alcohol and/or drug abuse.We also know that 19 percent of Ohio’s prison population is on the mental health caseload, yet mental health expenditures only account for half of one percent of the budget.More than 450 people with a mental illness are in two of Ohio’s most restrictive prisons.Solitary Watch reports, “Persons with mental illness often “have difficulty complying with strict prison rules, particularly when there is scant assistance to help them manage their disorders…”In 2007, a federal judge ruled that putting prisoners with mental illness in solitary confinement is “the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe.”Ohio Prisons Are Doing ItOhio routinely places individuals with mental illness in two of the most restrictive prisons in Ohio with little access to treatment and resources to aid rehabilitation.Learn more about ACLU of Ohio’s campaign to end solitary confinement in Ohio’s prisons.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
