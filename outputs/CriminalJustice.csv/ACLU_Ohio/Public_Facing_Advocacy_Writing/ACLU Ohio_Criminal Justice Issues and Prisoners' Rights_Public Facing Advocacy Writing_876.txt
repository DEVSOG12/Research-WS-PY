DeWine gave a general outline of Ohio’s distribution plan during a December 4 press conference, but failed to address a population at high risk of contracting the virus and experiencing potentially fatal outcomes: individuals in prisons, jails, and detention facilities.“Ohio has a moral and legal obligation to protect the lives and health of the people that it has chosen to hold as prisoners,” noted Freda Levenson, Legal Director for the ACLU of Ohio. “Moreover, to end this pandemic, Ohio’s distribution plan should be based on the scientific and public health evidence that dictates that we eradicate all major incubators of COVID-19. There is no valid justification for discriminating among people living in different types of congregate living facilities.”As of December 6, at least 9,299 Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction staff and individuals held in ODRC facilities have contracted COVID-19, and at least 116 have died. In May, the ACLU of Ohio and Policy Matters Ohio unveiled an analysis showing the COVID-19 death rate in Ohio prisons was nearly 10 times higher than in Ohio’s general population.“Ohio remains one of the worst states in the nation for fatality rates of individuals behind bars; by including incarcerated individuals in the immediate vaccination distribution plan Ohio could attempt to rewrite the narrative,” added Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director for the ACLU of Ohio. “Furthermore, a disproportionate number of the people in Ohio prisons and jails are Black and Latinx, members of the communities who have already suffered the most in the pandemic. There is no defensible reason to deny these individuals the same degree of priority accorded to residents of other congregate living facilities.”A copy of the letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfLtr_ACLU_DeWineVaccineFINAL_12072020_Redacted.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
