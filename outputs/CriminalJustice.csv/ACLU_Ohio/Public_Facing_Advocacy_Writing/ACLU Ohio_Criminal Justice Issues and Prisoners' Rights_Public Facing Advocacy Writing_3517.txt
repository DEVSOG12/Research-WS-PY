The coalition also urges Ohio lawmakers to require masks be worn by everyone within the Statehouse.These are common sense solutions that will not only protect the health and wellbeing of legislative and Statehouse staff, but also that of members of the press corps and members of the public who want to have their voices heard -throughout and after this pandemic - on legislation that will affect their lives for years to come.Even before the pandemic, the Ohio Statehouse itself and legislative proceedings were not very accessible to the general public. From taking off of work or caring for a loved one, to driving long distances, paying to park, navigating an unfamiliar building, and knowing where to readily access dates, times, and locations of hearings and how to properly submit testimony, participating in state legislative activity in-person can be a cumbersome and confusing process to most people. All of these obstacles have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health crisis that continues to ravage our state and nation.Read the full letter and view the list of organizations that signed on.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfKeep-Democracy-Open-By-Allowing-for-Virtual-Testimony-1.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on InstagramÂ© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
