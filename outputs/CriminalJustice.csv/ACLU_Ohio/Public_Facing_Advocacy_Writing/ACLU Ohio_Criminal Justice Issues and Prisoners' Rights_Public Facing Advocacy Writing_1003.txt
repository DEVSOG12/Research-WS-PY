The ACLU urged lawmakers to pass the legislation following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision yesterday in District Attorney’s Office v. Osbourne, which ruled that people have no constitutional right to DNA testing after their conviction. However, the ruling allowed states to extend those rights through legislation.ACLU of Ohio Staff Counsel Carrie Davis said, “Despite the many protections in our justice system, it is imperfect. For a variety of reasons, there are people who have been convicted of crimes who are innocent. Since the advent of DNA testing, at least 232 people nationwide who were found guilty of murder, rape, or other violent crimes were exonerated. Passing Senate Bill 77 will ensure that more people who may be innocent have access to these tests and that evidence will be preserved.”Ohio is one of 47 states to provide those convicted of a crime with limited access to DNA testing, however SB 77 would greatly expand those rights. The bill would grant access to DNA testing to a larger number of inmates and create more comprehensive protocols for how police departments store and maintain biological evidence. In addition, it also mandates that police record interrogations of those accused of some violent crimes and protects the integrity of police line-ups from possible bias.SB 77 passed committee unanimously on Wednesday, June 17 and is awaiting a full vote by the Senate. It is sponsored by Senator David Goodman (R-New Albany).“It is in everyone’s best interest to be sure the wrongdoer is convicted. When someone who is innocent is wrongfully convicted, it jeopardizes the integrity of the system and can deprive innocent people of years of their lives. It is imperative that the state pass legislation that guarantees access for all people to ensure that justice is served fairly and accurately,” Davis concluded.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
