This is despite current efforts by Ohio leaders to simplify the criminal code and to propose changes that will result in fewer people incarcerated in the state.The report is available at www.acluohio.org/statehouse-to-prison-2015.“This is a wake-up call for legislators to be a part of the solution and not a part of Ohio’s mass incarceration problem,” said Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio. “Our state’s prisons and jails are significantly overcrowded, incarcerating nearly 12,000 more people than capacity allows. Ohio families, communities, and taxpayers are bearing the brunt of our growing criminal justice system. This has been a problem for decades.”The report, “Ohio’s Statehouse-to-Prison Pipeline,” also shows that one in eight bills introduced by the Ohio House and one in 11 bills introduced by the Ohio Senate either enhanced, created, or expanded criminal penalties. The measures were introduced and supported by members of both political parties.The negative effects of mass incarceration are not limited to prisons and jail, but follow people with criminal convictions for the rest of their lives. With more offenses accompanied by steep felony charges, more people—especially people of color—must bear the stigma of being a felon. This makes it nearly impossible for these individuals to obtain housing, employment, and educational opportunities.“With Ohio having the sixth largest prisoner population in the United States, lawmakers need to stop the growth of mass incarceration and allow the Ohio Criminal Justice Recodification Committee to complete its work on criminal sentencing reforms,” Daniels said. “We are recommending that every legislator take a pledge not to introduce any bills that will place additional criminal penalties into state law; and that leadership in both the House and the Senate freeze any legislation that has already been introduced.”###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
