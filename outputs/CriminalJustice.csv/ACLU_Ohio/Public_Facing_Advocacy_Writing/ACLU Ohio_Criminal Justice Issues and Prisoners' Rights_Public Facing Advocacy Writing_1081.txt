New crime bills are so common in the capitol that hearings often overlap, forcing Gary to pick which bill to fight on any given day.The volume of incarceration bills gave the realistic optimist a powerful idea: count them. Show legislators that their numerous “small,” politically pleasing bills―on kittens, on drugs, on fantasy football―are part of a systemic problem that has created a pipeline to prison, especially for people of color.In the last session, Ohio legislators introduced over 90 bills to create new crimes, expand definitions of old ones, or increase prison time. One out of every ten bills introduced was a crime bill, an amazing statistic considering how many different subjects legislators are tasked with considering.Sixteen sentencing enhancement bills became law.Statehouse to Prison Pipeline 2017 shows legislators that mass incarceration is not an accident. It is a pipeline that starts with them when they introduce bills, often neglecting the effect it will have on Ohio’s incarceration crisis.Statehouse to Prison Pipeline 2017 pushes the focus for mass incarceration where it belongs: on deviant legislative practices. This tidal wave of crime bills, despite years of low crime rates, is not normal.1 in 9 bills in the House and 1 in 15 bills in the Senate enhanced, created or expanded criminal penalties.The report presents a provisional solution that fits the official legislative priorities of both parties: temporarily end the Statehouse’s role in the incarceration pipeline. Consider no new crime bills―zero―until the General Assembly’s Ohio Criminal Justice Recodification Committee upcoming report. The Recodification Committee is a two-year, $250,000 legislative effort to streamline, clarify and improve fairness in the bloated Ohio criminal code, a tome longer than War and Peace.Ohio legislators know they have an unhealthy addiction to crime bills. This report shows legislators why it is time to “Just Say No.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfOhio's Statehouse-to-Prison Pipeline - 131st General Assembly (2015-2016)Related contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
