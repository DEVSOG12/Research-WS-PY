The state executed Reginald Brooks today, who was the first person to be executed in nearly six months after a federal judge questioned the state’s lethal injection protocols. The death penalty commission met for the first time in October 2011, and will examine issues of fairness, due process, and racial disparity within the state’s death penalty system.“State officials showed courage when they decided to take a serious look at the severe problems plaguing Ohio’s death penalty system,” said ACLU of Ohio Executive Director Christine Link. “There is no sense to continuing executions while these important questions are being addressed. In the interest of fairness and justice for all the condemned, we cannot continue to use a fatally flawed system.”Previous studies conducted by the Associated Press and American Bar Association have raised serious questions regarding how the death penalty is applied in Ohio. Both studies found disparities in death penalty sentences based on the race of the victim and offender, economic class, and geography of where the crime occurred. The ABA study also noted significant concerns with the quality of defense many defendants receive in capital punishment cases.“The death penalty cannot be reversed. If state officials have even the smallest doubt that the system is unfair or unjust, they must not continue executions,” concluded Link. “If the state insists on imposing the death penalty, we must have confidence that the system works. The death penalty commission is exploring the very issues that have left many in the state doubting the system’s infallibility. By continuing to impose capital punishment, officials undermine the important work done by the commission.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
