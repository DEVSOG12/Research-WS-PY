Courts have been very clear that incarcerated people have a right to marriage, and blanket bans on that right are unconstitutional.“Madison County is essentially enforcing a ban on legal marriage,” said Elizabeth Bonham, staff attorney at the ACLU of Ohio. “An individual’s incarceration status does not disqualify them from the right to wed.”This same trend was seen in Hamilton County earlier this year, but as a result of a letter sent by the ACLU of Ohio, the Hamilton County Probate Court revoked its unconstitutional policy two weeks later. The Court also began proactively informing incarcerated people of how to obtain a marriage license.“Madison County is explicitly denying people marriage licenses because they are incarcerated. The right to marry is fundamental in the United States – plain and simple – yet policies like this reinforce the erasure and oppression of incarcerated people. There is no justification for this marriage ban and the ACLU is calling on Madison County to end its practice immediately,” said Bonham.###Read the letter to the Madison County Probate CourtStay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeGeneral Civil LibertiesPrisoners' RightsDocumentspdfLetterToMadisonProbateCourt-2017_1116.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022FAQ: Power of State SenatorJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of Ohio Secretary of StateJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State RepresentativeJuly 14, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
