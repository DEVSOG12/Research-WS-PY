The ACLU of Ohio has submitted public feedback on Criminal Rule 46 twice before, reiterating the overarching concern that it lacks the procedural safeguards necessary to change bail-setting practices.“Individuals who remain in jail pretrial, compared with those arrested for the same crime who are able to purchase their release, are more likely to get convicted, be sentenced to jail and prison, and receive sentences that are two to three times longer,” noted Claire Chevrier, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of Ohio. “Unless the Supreme Court of Ohio submits another version of Criminal Rule 46 to the Ohio general Assembly, wealth-based detention will continue.”The ACLU notes that one proposed change that would have made a true difference was the previous requirement that financial conditions of release be limited to situations in which defendants pose a risk of non-appearance. The most recent version of Criminal Rule 46 now provides that financial conditions of bail be related to a defendant’s “risk of non-appearance, the seriousness of the offense, and the previous criminal record of the defendant.”“Cash bail does not promote public safety, it simply allows wealthier individuals to pay for their release while stranding other individuals behind bars unnecessarily. The justice one receives should not depend on their zip code or whether they land before a judge who has the courage to recognize that common bail-setting practices violate the constitution,” concluded Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director for the ACLU of Ohio.The letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfSCO-CR-46-Letter_04152020.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
