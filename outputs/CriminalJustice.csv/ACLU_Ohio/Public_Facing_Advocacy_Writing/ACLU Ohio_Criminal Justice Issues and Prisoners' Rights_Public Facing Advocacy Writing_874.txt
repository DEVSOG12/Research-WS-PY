Police roughed up and arrested Mr. Pettit for recording them and calling them out on their mistreatment of his neighbors—which included smacking a compliant teenager on the face. The ACLU of Ohio filed a civil rights complaint for damages for the retaliation against Mr. Pettit’s exercise of his constitutional rights to record and speak to the police. “Mr. Pettit had a right to not just observe, but also to record and criticize police mistreatment of his neighbors.  This all occurred in a public space. When they suppressed his speech, the Columbus Police effectively said to him and his community: we have impunity; we may abuse you without consequences. Nick is standing up to correct that,” said Elizabeth Bonham, Staff Attorney for the ACLU of Ohio. Mr. Petitt was held in jail for five days before charges were brought against him for this event. On April 29, he was charged for ‘Misconduct at an Emergency’. The Columbus City Prosecutor dropped the charges before trial based on insufficient evidence. “Mr. Pettit was imprisoned for five days without charges based on the exercise of his fundamental rights. The retaliation and the needless pretrial detention initiated a cascade of traumas in his life including the loss of a job opportunity. We demand justice for our client,” concluded Bonham. This lawsuit, Pettit v Morrow et al, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.A copy of the complaint is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfComplaint.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
