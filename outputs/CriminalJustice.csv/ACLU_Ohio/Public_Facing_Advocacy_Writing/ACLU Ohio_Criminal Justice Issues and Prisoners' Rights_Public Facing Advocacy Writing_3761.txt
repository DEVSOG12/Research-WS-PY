Unable to stabilize their lives, many of these people end up back in the system, assuming they ever actually left.  And so the cycle goes.Judge Klide is not the only person who realizes the errors of the past.  He is but one member of the Criminal Justice Reform Committee formed under the umbrella of Coming Together Stark County. The committee is a cross-section of everyone in Stark County– younger, older, black, white, former elected officials, academics, students, and people who know these problems firsthand.Their victories include persuading local governments in Canton,Stark County,Massillon, and Alliance to “ban the box,” a somewhat misleading term that pushes criminal background checks toward the end of the interview process rather than the start. The idea is that employers get to know the person, their skills, and their work experience instead of immediately “filing” the application or resume in the garbage can because of a checked box revealing an unfortunate past.The committee invited me to speak with them two weeks ago, where I shared news about private prisons, sentencing reform, and efforts yet to bear fruit. Very little of what I said was news to any of these citizens who have selflessly banded together to effect positive change in their community.When I left, I could not help but think I learned more from them than they did from me.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
