The case was presided over by Lorain County Common Pleas Judge James Burge. The ACLU of Ohio represented Ruben Rivera and Ronald McCloud who are charged, but not convicted, with crimes that may qualify them for the death penalty. Judge Burge ruled that the three drug cocktail given to those executed did not work properly and called on the state for a new drug combination that would work without risk of causing the person excruciating pain.ACLU of Ohio Legal Director Jeffrey Gamso said, “This decision sends a strong message that the state must treat every person with basic human dignity. The evidence shows that lethal injection is fraught with problems and can oftentimes be very painful. ”“Although the decision does not suspend the death penalty in Ohio, it does require the state to execute individuals in a manner that does not inflict terrible pain and respects the person’s basic human rights,” continued Gamso.The decision marks the first victory in a state court challenging the constitutionality of lethal injection procedures.In recent years, Ohio has had increasing public scrutiny over the use of lethal injection. In 2006, the state botched the execution of Joseph L. Clark after his veins repeatedly collapsed. Reports claim he appeared to be in pain and stated that the procedure was not working. In 2007, the state also experienced problems with the execution of Christopher Newton. The execution lasted over an hour and a half, because the state could not find veins in his arms. A typical execution lasts around 20 minutes.Gamso concluded, “The court’s decision hopefully ensures that no other person will have to go through the experience of Mr. Clark and Mr. Newton. If Ohio must have capital punishment, it must guarantee that it is performed humanely and without undue risk of serious complications.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
