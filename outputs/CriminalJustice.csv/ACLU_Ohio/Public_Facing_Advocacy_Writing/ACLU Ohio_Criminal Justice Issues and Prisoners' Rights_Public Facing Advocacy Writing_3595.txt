The ACLU of Ohio supports any efforts to improve Ohio’s criminal justice system, but has noted several ways to strengthen the legislation including: making retroactive and increasing eligibility for SB 3’s unclassified misdemeanor provisions, robust data collection and reporting, and removing the ability to incarcerate people for technical violations of community control sanctions.The following statement is attributable to Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio:"The ACLU of Ohio is thankful for the current attention devoted to improving drug policy and the lives of countless Ohioans impacted by drug problems. SB 3 is recognition our decades-long approach to locking people up for substance use and abuse needs changed. That said, SB 3 is also a mix of positive, incomplete, and sometimes counterproductive policy. The ACLU of Ohio will continue to work to ensure SB 3 is as beneficial as possible."###Read the letter to Senator Eklund.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfLetterToSenatorEklund-SenateBill3-Feedback_2019-0313_Redacted.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
