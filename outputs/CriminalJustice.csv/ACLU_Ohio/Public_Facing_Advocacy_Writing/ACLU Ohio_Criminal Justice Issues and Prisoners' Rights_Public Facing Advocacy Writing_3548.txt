It compromises safety and security, not only for the incarcerated, but for the people who staff these facilities.”In the midst of a heat wave, media reports indicate that up to 24 of Ohio’s correctional institutions have made agreements to restrict electricity during peak hours, cutting power to lights and fans and raising the temperature to nearly 90 degrees in some areas.The reports come on the heels of yet another incident at the privately run Lake Erie Correctional Institution (LaECI). The incident reportedly involved dozens of inmates in multiple fights in the prison yard. Prison officials have reportedly brought in emergency staff to regain control of the facility and are conducting a prison-wide shakedown of inmates.“These problems at the Lake Erie Correctional Institution and other prisons have shown that these facilities are unpredictable even under normal circumstances,” added Brickner. “Cutting the power during a heat wave to make money is very short-sighted. Long term, it is a recipe for trouble.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticePrisoners' RightsRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
