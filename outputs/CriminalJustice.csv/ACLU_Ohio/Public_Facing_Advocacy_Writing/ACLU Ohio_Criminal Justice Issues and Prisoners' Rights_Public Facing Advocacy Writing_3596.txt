The report, Ohio’s Statehouse-to-Prison Pipeline: 132nd General Assembly 2017-2018, reveals that our elected officials are damaging their own “multi-year effort” to simplify the criminal code by lengthening sentences and proposing new criminal offenses.“Mass incarceration begins at the statehouse,” said Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio. “The effects of continually doing what doesn’t work are well-documented, and the purpose of this report is to highlight the role and responsibility of the Ohio General Assembly in maintaining our state’s ongoing, dangerously crowded prison system” The report identifies that 12% of all bills would put more people in prison or jail.A similar report was issued in 2017, analyzing the 131st legislative session, and the ACLU found that while the Senate introduced 28 fewer bills in total, it included 19 more bills with mass incarceration implications when compared to the prior session, jumping from 6.4% to 12.3% of all bills introduced in the Senate. “We cannot arrest, convict, and incarcerate our way out of this crisis, and while our legislature remains paralyzed by inaction, our communities are suffering; especially communities of Color,” added Daniels.The report, Ohio’s Statehouse-to-Prison Pipeline 2019 edition, calls for a series of reforms, and the ACLU of Ohio urges legislative leaders to: stop introducing bills that create new crimes, instruct caucuses not to advance legislation already introduced that create new crimes or criminal penalties, and to freeze sentencing enhancements permanently.###Read the full report.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
