Pay-to-stay fees are charges assigned to people by county jails in the form of booking fees or daily fees while they are incarcerated.“Balancing jail budgets on the backs of people in poverty will simply never work,” said Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the ACLU of Ohio. “In fact, pay-to-stay fees can send people hurling back into the criminal justice system by loading them with debt that makes it that much harder to successfully return to our communities. These policies can take a simple traffic offense and spiral it into thousands of dollars in debt.”At a meeting of the Multi-County Correctional Center Board two people who had been subject to pay-to-stay fees spoke to board members about how these practices impacted their lives and urged the board to eliminate them altogether.“Many of the people in our jails are struggling with addiction and mental illness,” Brickner said. “Charging these fees means that those same people are now being harassed by collections agencies after their sentence is over, and have few options or resources to seek treatment.”Read the report: "In Jail & In Debt: Ohio's Pay-to-Stay Fees."Last November, the ACLU released the report In Jail & In Debt: Ohio’s Pay-to-Stay Fees that looked at the devastating effects these practices have on low-income people. Since the release of the report, three more counties have eliminated daily fees for people in their jails.“Corrections officials and criminal justice advocates have the same goals to keep people out of jail, and rehabilitate those who are there,” Brickner said. “The dozens of other jails around the state that charge these fees should stop immediately. State officials should reexamine the law and eliminate pay-to-stay jail fees entirely, so we can support those who are returning to our communities and work towards depopulating our overcrowded jails.”###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
