Many of the so-called "Pipeline Bills" may seem innocuous, but the result is a relentless, haphazard escalation of laws that imprison people.”Even when crime falls, imprisonment does not. As of February 11, 2021, ODRC Director Annette Chambers-Smith announced that the prison population in Ohio is at 118% capacity.  The ACLU of Ohio has analyzed three full legislative sessions and with each report are able to identify trends across the years and the chambers. The total number of “Pipeline” bills introduced fell compared to the 132nd and 131st OGA, and while the House numbers improved over time, the Senate continues to introduce more and more crime bills, year after year.“This trend must stop. We cannot arrest, convict, and incarcerate our way out of this crisis, and while our legislature remains paralyzed by inaction, our communities are suffering; especially communities of Color,” added Daniels.In the report, Ohio’s Statehouse-to-Prison Pipeline: 133rd General Assembly (2019-2020), the ACLU of Ohio urges legislative leaders to: stop introducing bills that create new crimes or place additional penalties into state law, and to instruct caucuses not to advance legislation already introduced that creates new crimes or criminal penalties.Read the full report.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfSTPP_Report2021_2021-0204.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
