The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is decrying the passage of House Bill 663 and calls for Gov. John Kasich to veto it in the following statement by Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the ACLU of Ohio.“Ohio lawmakers rushed through this legislation in the final days of the session, making the specter of more problems with future lethal injections likelier. This legislation is unequivocally bad for Ohio. It will shield drug manufacturers and medical professionals who assist in executions from public records laws and will make it difficult for courts to monitor executions. It also will provide immunity to those individuals from ethical or professional reprimands for their participation in executions. The public, courts, and condemned prisoners should not be kept in the dark. They need to understand how executions are to be carried out and that they will comply with our laws. HB 663 not only violates the public’s trust, it is fundamentally wrong and will certainly be challenged in the courts. We urge Gov. Kasich not to sign it.”The bill will go to the Ohio House for a concurrence vote before arriving at Gov. John Kasich’s desk.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
