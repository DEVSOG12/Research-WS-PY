This legislation is designed to add significantly more people to Ohio’s already dangerously overcrowded prison system, at a time when Ohio has gained national and international attention about the widespread problems with COVID-19 in ODRC facilities. The ACLU of Ohio urges a ‘no’ vote on SB 55.“It is unconscionable the Ohio General Assembly remains almost entirely silent during this emergency regarding reducing our prison population and is now poised to exacerbate the problem. COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire in our prisons – this is a crisis more serious and unlike any we have seen in Ohio prison history. We urge Ohio House Representatives to vote ‘no’ on SB 55 which epitomizes the statehouse-to-prison-pipeline,” added Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio.Senate Bill 55 would increase drug trafficking penalties by one degree if the offense takes place within 1,000 feet of a treatment center. Furthermore, the bill does not require the defendant to know they are within 1,000 feet of a treatment center, or that the person they sell to is actually undergoing treatment at the location in question.“In larger urban areas where more treatment centers are available, like Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, and Dayton, SB 55 will create large swaths where anyone caught selling drugs will face increased punishment. All the prosecutor needs to do is break out a tape measure,” concluded Daniels.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
