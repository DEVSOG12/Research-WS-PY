And once the money is in the account, using it to keep in touch is more expensive than you might think.Watch the ACLU of Ohio’s own Mike Brickner discussing prison fees on WOSU’s All Side’s with Ann FisherIn Ohio, it costs up to 33 cents to send one e-mail from prison. A Skype video chat costs $10. Phone calls can be even more expensive, since the company that provides phone service pays Ohio $15 million a year to keep a monopoly on the system.Until the FCC finally intervened in 2013, it cost $17.14 for a 15-minute call from prison, about a month’s pay for a working inmate. Today it still costs 25 cents per minute to call a loved one, much higher than the national average.Prison officials say they rely on these steep fees (and the huge commission they receive from service providers) to balance their ballooning prison budgets, but they are also contributing to a vicious cycle.Connection with the outside world is one of the best predictors of whether prisoners will rehabilitate their lives and reintegrate into society after their release. The more contact they have with loved ones, the greater their chances to someday become a productive member of society.Gouging these prisoners and their families at every turn may generate some short-term profit, but long term it only makes it more likely that they will stay in prison, or return after being released.This is the fundamental flaw of mass incarceration. We fund our prisons using methods that make it harder for prisoners to be successful once they leave. As a result, more people come back to prison, budgets skyrocket, and we need even more money to fund the system.The only way to solve our nation’s prison problem is to focus like a laser on keeping people out of jail in the first place and helping those who do end up behind bars get out and stay out for good.Balancing our budgets on the backs of the poorest Ohioans accomplishes neither of these goals.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
