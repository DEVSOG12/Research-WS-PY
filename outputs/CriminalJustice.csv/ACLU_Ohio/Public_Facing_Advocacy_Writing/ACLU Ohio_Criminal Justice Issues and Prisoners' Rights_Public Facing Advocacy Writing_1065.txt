Less crime, less violence – what could be bad about that? But this is a DOJ that has signaled its support for the use of dragnet style policing, aggressive enforcement of drug laws, and targeting of vulnerable groups – all of which make our communities more dangerous. We knew it was bad news.We continued to sound the alarm to Toledo officials, but they had already – under the table and without input from residents – agreed to the deal. So we did what Toledo officials wouldn't. We talked with Toledo residents and asked them what they need to feel safe in their city. An attendee at our May 2018 community forum said: “We are the experts of our neighborhoods.” We agree.Bring these recommendations with you when you meet with your City Council member, community group, or police officer, and urge them to commit to adopting these recommendations.In the months of collecting feedback via forums, meetings, canvasses, and surveys, two main themes arose. First, that residents will never feel safe if they fear unfair treatment from their government based on who they are. And, at the same time, that ensuring safety is much bigger than what police officers do or don’t do. While police use of force and racial profiling came up very often, so did discussions of the services and opportunities residents want to see in their neighborhoods.We are proud to announce that today we sent Toledo officials a set of recommendations for advancing safety for all Toledoans. These recommendations provide tangible steps the City of Toledo can take to work toward safety for all residents, regardless of their identity.We could not have done this without you. Please join us in calling on Toledo to adopt these recommendations. There can be no safety without justice.The ACLU of Ohio and CSRN of Toledo's recommendations can be found here.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeGeneral Civil LibertiesLGBTQ RightsPolice PracticesRacial JusticeDocumentspdfACLUofOhio_ToledoSafeForAll-PolicyRecommendations_2018-1010.pdfpdfToledoSafeForAll-PolicyRecommendations_2018-1017.pdfpdfToledoSafeForAll-PolicyRecommendations_2018-1017.pdfpdfToledoSafeForAll-PolicyRecommendations_2018-1017.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio, Equality Ohio, and TransOhio Celebrate Trans Joy...October 13, 2022Coming Out On Your Own Time and Your Own TermsOctober 7, 2022When Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022ACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Opposition to proposed State Board of Education resolution “to...September 19, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Poll Worker Tips: Interacting Respectfully with Transgender and...August 31, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
