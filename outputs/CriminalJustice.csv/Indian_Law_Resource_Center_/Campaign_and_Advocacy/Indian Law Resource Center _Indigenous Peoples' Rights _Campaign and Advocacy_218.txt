Senators Al Franken (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), Daniel K. Inouye (D-HA), Mark Begich (D-AK), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Max Baucus (D-MT) are co-sponsors.The statistics are staggering.  One in three Native women is raped in her lifetime, and six in ten experience physical abuse.  Worse, four out of five perpetrators of these crimes are non-Indians who cannot be prosecuted by Tribes under current United States law.  If enacted in conjunction with the 2011 VAWA reauthorization, the SAVE Native Women Act would be life-saving legislation intended to strengthen tribal jurisdiction, provide safety to Native women, and repair the broken and fragmented criminal justice system that fails to protect them. GET INVOLVED!Make your voice be heard on Capitol Hill.  Testimony should be emailed to: testimony@indian.senate.gov.Visit www.indianlaw.org/safewomen for more information on the Center’s Safe Women, Strong Nations project and learn how you can take action now to help end violence against Native women.DO SOMETHING!  Now is the time to make a stand and seek legislation to end the epidemic of violence against Native women.SiteWorking to protect the legal rights, cultures and environments of Indian nations and other indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1978.About UsWe are a non-proﬁt law and advocacy organization.ContinueSubscribeSubscribe to Indigenous Notes for the latest news from the Center.Email:Take ActionHelp Support and Protect Indigenous Rights.ContinueAboutBoard of DirectorsStaffEmploymentInternshipsAnnual ReportsFinancial InformationContact UsIssuesEnding Violence Against Native WomenEnvironmental ProtectionHUMAN RIGHTSLAND RIGHTSLaw ReformNATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-GOVERNANCEPROTECTING SACRED SITESProjectsLAW REFORMMultilateral Development BanksThe American Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous PeoplesWorld Conference on Indigenous PeoplesContact UsMain Office602 North Ewing StreetHelena, MT 59601406.449.2006mt@indianlaw.orgD.C.
