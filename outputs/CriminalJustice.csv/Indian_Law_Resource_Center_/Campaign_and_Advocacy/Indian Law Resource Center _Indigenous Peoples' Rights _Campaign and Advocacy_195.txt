More than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence, and more than 1 in 2 have experienced sexual violence. Alaska Native women continue to suffer the highest rate of forcible sexual assault and have reported rates of domestic violence up to 10 times higher than in the rest of the United States. Though available data is limited, the number of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and the lack of a diligent and adequate federal response is extremely alarming to indigenous women, tribal governments, and communities. On some reservations, indigenous women are murdered at more than ten times the national average.Statistics define the scale of the problem, but do nothing to convey the experience of the epidemic. They tell part of the story, but fail to account for the devastating impacts this violence has on the survivors, Indian families, Native communities, and Indian nations themselves. Native children exposed to violence suffer rates of PTSD three times higher than the rest of the general population. Nevertheless, the statistics make absolutely clear that violence against Native women is a crisis that cannot wait to be addressed.The Center’s Safe Women, Strong Nations project partners with Native women’s organizations and Indian and Alaska Native nations to end violence against Native women and children.  Our project:•    raises awareness to gain strong federal action to end violence against Native women and children;•    provides legal advice to Native women’s organizations and Indian nations on ways to restore tribal criminal authority and to preserve tribal civil authority; and•    helps Indian and Alaska Native nations and Native women’s organizations increase their capacity to prevent violence and to hold perpetrators of violence on their lands accountable.We must act together to restore safety to Native women and children and to help Indian nations address the appalling cycle of violence in Native communities. The time is now.Video: To The Indigenous Woman - Uncut, Long VersionProject Overview Racial Discrimination and Denial of Equality Under the Law Violation of Human Rights Reforming Federal Law to Restore Safety to Native Women Training Native Women, Communities, and Tribal LeadersAll Our ProjectsHandbooks for ConservationistsUnited StatesThe Indian Law Resource Center is writing a one-of-a-kind handbook for conservationists that will help build collaboration between...Implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous PeoplesHelping Indian leaders initiate, win, and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has been an important part of...Indigenous Lands InitiativeSecuring Land Ownership Rights for Indigenous Communities in Mexico and Central and South America – Indian tribes in Mexico and in Central and...Indigenous Peoples in Brazil and the AmazonHistorically, Brazil has served as a model demonstrating the potential for reducing deforestation by strengthening indigenous peoples’ legal land...Land of the Brave – A Western Shoshone DocumentaryThe Indian Law Resource Center is pleased to support LAND OF THE BRAVE - Broken Treaty III, a sequel to the acclaimed BROKEN TREATY AT...Law ReformOur Law Reform project is directed at increasing understanding and support for the sovereign rights of Indian and Alaska Native nations and assisting...Maya Q'eqchi' Land and Resource RightsIn Guatemala, extractive industry and conservation projects are threatening the special relationship the indigenous peoples have with their lands and...Multilateral Development BanksMultilateral development banks (MDBs) and some national development banks play a central role in the approval of large-scale development projects,...Protecting Alaska's RiversThe Center has a long history of environmental advocacy in Alaska.
