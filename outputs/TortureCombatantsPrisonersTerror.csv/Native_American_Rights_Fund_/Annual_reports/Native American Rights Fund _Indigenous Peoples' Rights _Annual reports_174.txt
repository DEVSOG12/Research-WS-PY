The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the national 
Indian legal defense fund whose primary work centers on 
the preservation and protection of Indian rights and 
resources. NARF began its work in 1970 with a planning 
grant from the Ford Foundation and through the years has 
grown into a reputable and well-respected advocate of 
Indian interests. 
Slnce its beglnnings, NARF has worked in conjunction 
with many people to seek judicial and negotiated solutions 
to long-standing Indian grievances, uncertainties and 
problems. NARF's partners have included tribal leaders, 
tribal attorneys, government attorneys and legal services 
attorneys. 
It is time to heal our communities and our nations. Tribal 
nations and the United States both stand to benefit 
immensely by stepping towards recovery and righting the 
relationship that continues to suffer because of wide scale 
denial and ignorance of the history of the United States 
boarding scllool policy. Like a lot of the details of the 
Annua l Report 2013 United States historical relations with the indigenous inhab­
itants of this land, the story of the Indian boarding school 
policy of the United States government has largely been 
written out of the history books. Through this policy, Native 
American children were forcibly abducted from their homes 
and put into Christian and government run boarding 
schools beginning ln the mid 1800's, continuing into the 
1950's, and in some cases until the 1970's. The boarding 
school policy represented a shift from genocide of Indian 
people to a more defensible, but no less insidious, policy of 
cultural genocide -the systematic destruction of indigenous 
communities through the removal and reprogramming of 
their children. 
Children were held in isolation in regimented and sterile 
settings. Separated from their homes and communities, they 
were placed in dormitory settings fashioned after the mili­
tary model where they were controlled, trained, neglected 
and abused. They were punished for speaking their native 
languages, banned from acting in any way representative of 
traditional or cultural practices, stripped of tradjtional Native American Right s Fund

clothing, hair and all things and behaviors reflective of their 
cultures. They were intentionally and systematically incul­
cated with shame for being Indian through ridicule of their 
reUgions and their life-ways; shame that became internalized 
as self-loathing and emotional disenfranchisement for their 
own cultures. 
Those victimized in the schools, their children, grandchil­
dren and great-grandchildren, have become the legacy of the 
boarding schools and the federal policy that established and 
sustained them. Many of those that returned to their com­
munities came as wounded human beings. Denied the 
security and safety necessary for healthy growth and devel­
opment, they retained only fractured cultural skills to connect 
them with their families and communities. These survivors 
were left with varying degrees of scars and skills, but most 
profoundly, of psychological subordination. Many report 
feeling self-hatred for being Indian; bereft of spirit, knowl­
edge, language and social tools to reenter their own societies. 
With only Umited labor skills, exacerbated by the subordi­
nated spirit trained into them, too many carried undefined u

and unremitting arudeties that drove them to alcoholism, 
drug abuse, violence against their own families and commu­
nities, and suicide. 
To address this long-standing issue, NARF was instru­
mental in the formation of the National Native American 
Boarding School HeaHng Coalition (N-HABS-HC or 
Coalition) to formulate a specific strategy and framework to 
pursue healing. The main goal of the CoaUtion is healing. The 
full extent and depth of the impacts of the boarding schools 
to our nations, communities, and families and indivicllual 
victims must first be better understood. The Coalition will 
ask the Congress to create a Commission on Boarding 
School Policy with the full and active participation of 
impacted Native Americans at all stages to carry out a range 
of essential tasks. The tasks of the commission can be sum­
marized as providing information about what happened at 
the boarding schools, who was involved, what impacts are 
ongoing, what healing models are available and working, 
and what scientific developments can support healing 
models. 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
In order to raise awareness of the issues, and to gamer 
support for establishment of a congressional commission, 
project staff have been conducting outreach among (ma;tly) 
regional trilbal organizations. NARF and Coalition represen­
tatives offer a presentation on the goals of the Coalition and 
request a resolution in support of the plan. To date, resolu­
tions of support have been passed by National Congress of 
American Indians, National Indian Health Board, Atflliated 
Tribes of Northwest Indians, lntertribal Council of Nevada, 
Montana/ Wyoming Tribal Leaders Association and the 
Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council. We have provided draft 
resolutions and had discussions with staff or leaders from a 
number of other regional tribal organJzations, and are con­
tinuing to contact others. 
Congressional members and their staff also need to be 
educated about the boarding school policy and its continued 
impacts. NARF has initiated contact with interested 
Congressional staff, and plans to distribute educational 
materials. The project will initiate one or more Congressional 
briefing se�ons to provide education to relevant staffers. 
Then we can request one or more oversight hearings to 
make the case for action necessary to address the continuing 
harms of the boarding school policy and to provide informa­
tion directly to Congressional members. 
The project also held discussions with the White House 
and sought the benefit of guidance about the prospects for 
Executive and Administrative attention du.ring the remain­
der of this Presidential Term. Based on those discussions, 
high level administrative officials, particularly in the 
Departments of Interior, Education, and Justice will be 
recruited to support and provide guidance as the project 
progresses. 
It wilJ also be essential to generate the support of the 
churches that were involved in the initiation and implemen­
tation of the boarding school policy. Because of their insti­
tutional histories, the churches involved in the boarding 
school policy might be anticipated to provide resistance to 
bringing the harmful aspects of those histories to Ught. 
However, as moral leaders and institutions that serve as 
guideposts for right action, the c hurches also have an oppor­
tunity to serve in leadership roles in providing examples of 
how to right a past wrong. 
Annua l Report 2013 NARF's Funding 
NARF's existence would not be possible without the 
efforts of the thousands of individuals who have offered 
their knowledge, courage and vision to help guide NARF on 
its quest. Of equal importance, NARF's financial contribu­
tors have graciously provided the resources to give our 
efforts life. Contributors such as the Ford Foundation have 
been with NARF since its inception. The Open Society 
Institute and the Bay and Paul Foundations have made long 
term funding commitments. Also, the positive effects of 
NARF's work are reflected in the financial contributions by 
a growing number of tribal governments like the Yocha 
Dehe Wintun Nation, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the 
Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, tlhe San 
Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the Muckleshoot Tribe, 
the Sycuan Band of Kumeyaay, the Confederated Tribes of 
Siletz Indians, the Tulalip Tubes, the Chickasaw Nation, 
and the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. United, these finan­
cial, moral, and intellectual gifts provide the framework for 
NARF to fulfill its goal of securing the right to self-determi­
nation to which all Native American peoples are entitled. 
Finally, NARF's legal work was greatly enhanced by the on­
going generous pro bona contributions by the law firms of 
DLA Piper and Patton Boggs LLP. Their many hours of 
work made it possible for NARF to present the best positions 
possible and to move forward in insuring NARF's success. 
NARF's Priorities 
One of the initial responsibilities of NARF's first Board of 
Directors was to develop priorities that would guide the 
Native American Rights Fund in its mission to preserve and 
enforce the legal rights of Native Americans. That Board 
developed five priorities that continue to lead NARF today: 
• Preservation of tribal existence 
• Protection of tribal natural resources 
• Promotion of Native American human rights 
• Accountability of governments to Native Americans 
• Development of Indian law and educating the public 
about Indian rights, laws, and issues Native American Right s Fund 
As my term on the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) 
Board of Directors comes to an end in 2014, 
I would Like to call attention to a startling shift in funding 
at NARF NARF was founded in 1970 through a grant 
from the Ford Foundation, and has relied heavily on 
institutional funding throughout its history. At the NARF 
Board meeting this past November the Development 
Director reported that gifts from tribes now comprised the 
single largest source of NARF funding. 
The shift is clear. A recent study by Native Americans in 
Philanthropy (NAP) bears this out: over the last decade, 
funding for lnc:lian Country from mainstream foundations 
has declined by 40%. This has affected NARF too, but 
more than 40 tribes have stepped up to fill NARF's gap in 
foundation funding. It is gratifying to receive support from 
the constituency we serve! 
At that same Board meeting, it was aJso reported that 
during 2013, NARF had 92 active cases, special projects, 
and other activities CTndian Child Welfare, Sacred Sites, 
Climate Change, Education, Water Rights, Trust 
Responsibility, and Federal Recognition -to name a few} 
that consume time, energy, and money. While it is very 
good that we could dedicate st.aff to represent 92 specific 
needs, there were many additional requests for l.egal assis­
tance that had to be turned down due to the lack of finan­
cial resources to acquire the legal st.aft' necessary to take on 
the additional work load. 
The need for NARF to serve those who are unable to 
afford legal counsel has never been greater. It is very clear 
that at every tum, there are constant attempts to erode 
lndfan country's determination to self-govern and manage 
its affairs. It is also apparent that the United States Supreme 
Court continues to allow politics to cloud its judicial deci­
sion making. In concert with the National Congress of 
American Indians, NARF continues to monitor cases and 
decisions of this H.igh Court. The reports are not good, and 
show no signs of positive change. 
One strategy to diminish harmful judicial decisions is to 
settle those cases out of court. NARF has been very effective in assisting with negotiated settlements in many instances 
and will continue this strategy, especiaJly in light of this 
Court. To that end, we need your helpl 
On behalf of the Board, I respectfully request that all of 
Indian Country contribute financially, and at levels that you 
choose. That said, I am pleased and proud to say that each 
of the NARF Board of Director members have made their 
personaJ financial contribution in 2013. 
I thank all who have contributed to NARF in the past and 
encourage you to continue giving in the future. 
For those who haven't thought about giving, please do.

Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
2013 marked the 43rd year that the Native American 
Rights Fund has been providing legal advice and assistance 
to Indian tribes, organizations and individuaJs in cases of 
major national significance. Our legaJ representation once 
again resulted in several important victories and accomplish­
ments for Indian country during the year. 
Diane ]. Humetewa, an enrolled member of the Hopi 
Tribe, was nominated by President Barak Obama to serve as 
a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Ariwna. The Native American Rights Fund worked with 
several Native organizations as part of the Judicial Selection 
Project to urge the nomination of Ms. Humetewa, a well­
qualified Native American attorney, for the position. If con­
firmed by the Senate, Ms. Humetewa would be the only 
Native American serving as a judge in the federal judicial 
system. 
On behalf of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, the Native 
American Rights Fund was successful in securing approval 
from the EnvironmentaJ Protection Agency (EPA) of the 
application of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern 
Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming 
to be treated in the same manner as a state in the adminis­
tration of certain Clean Air Act programs. The decision of 
the EPA to approve the application also determined that the 
boundaries of the Wind River Reservation were not altered 
by the Surplus Land Act of March 3, 1905. The decision ls 
being appealed by the State of Wyoming. 
In Al<iachak Native Community v. Department of Interior, 
the Native American Rights Fund obtained a favorable 
federal court decision on behalf of several Alaska tribes 
invalidating the federal regulation that barred the Secretary 
of the Interior from acquiring land in trust in Alaska other 
than for the MetJakatla Indian Community or its members. 
The decision is being appeaJed by the State of Alaska. 
Represented by the Native American Rights Fund, the 
Klamath Tribes had their time immemoriaJ priority date 
water rights to support the Tribes' treaty hunting, fishing, 
trapping and gathering rights confirmed in the Final Order 
of Determination issued by the Oregon Water Resources 
Annua l Report 2013 Department {OWRD) in the Klamath Basin Adjudication 
{KBA). For the first time ever, the Tribes are able to enforce 
their water rights. OWRD's determination of the Tribes' 
rights, as weU as all other water rights asserted in the KBA, 
are now subject to judicial review in an Oregon state court. 
Settlement negotiations are also in process that may finally 
settle the Tribes' water rights claims. 
In Katiefohn v. Norton, the Native American Rights Fund 
represents an Alaska Native asserting priority subsistence 
flshi ng and hunting rights provided by the Alaska National 
lntecest Lands Conservation Act. We prevajled in a decision 
by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting the State of 
Alaska's challenge to the plan of the Secretary of the Interior 
and the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Act. 
The Court held that it was reasonable for the Secretaries Native American Right s Fund 
to decide that the pubUc lands subject to the Act's rural 
subsistence priority included the waters within and adjacent 
to federal reservations in Alaska. The State of Alaska is 
seeking review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In Native Village of Tununak v. State of Alaska, the Alaska 
Supreme Court issued an important ruling holding that the 
Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) implicitly mandates that 
good cause to deviate from ICWA's adoptive placement 
preferences which favor Natives be proved by clear and 
convincing evidence, not the weaker preponderance of the 
evidence standard. Alaska had been the only state where 
courts had applied the preponderance of the evidence burden 
of proof to findings of good cause to deviate from ICWA's 
adoption pref:erences. The Native American Rights 
authored an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the Native 
Village of Kotzebue. 
The Indian Tribal Justice and Legal Assistance Act author­
izes the Department of Justice to provide supplemental 
funding to Indian legal services programs for the representa-tion of Indian people and tribes which fall below federal 
poverty guideBnes. On behalf of the 25 Indian legal services 
programs that the Indian Law Support Center at the Natrive 
American Rights Fund works with, we appHed for and 
received civil and criminal grants of $715,000 and 
$515.000 respectively for civil and criminal assistance in 
tribal courts. The grants were distributed to the Indian legal 
services programs. 
These 2013 victories and accomplishments for Indian 
country would not have been possible without the generosity 
of our many contributors across the United States. We thank 
you for your assistance and encourage you to continue your 
support of our Indian legal advocacy efforts in 2014.

Annua l Report 2013 Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
Under the priority of the preservation of tribal existence, 
NARF works to construct the foundations that are necessary 
to empower tribes so that they can continue to live accord­
ing to their Native traditions, to enforce their treaty rights, 
to insure their independence on reservations and to protect 
their sovereignty. 
Specifically, NARF's legal representation centers on 
sovereignty and jurisdiction issues and also on federal recog­
nition and restoration of tribal status. Thus, the focus of 
NARF's work involves issues relating to the preservation 
and enforcement of the status of tribes as sovereign govern­
ments. Tribal governments possess the power to regulate the 
internal affairs of their members as well as other activities 
within their reservations. Jurisdktional conflicts often arise 
with states, the federal government and others over tribal 
sovereignty. 
Tribal Sovereignty 
The focus of NARF's work under this priority is the 
protection of the status of tribes as sovereign, self-governing 
entities. The United States Constitution recognizes that 
Indian tribes are independent governmental entities with 
inherent authority over their members and territory. In 
treaties with the United States, Indian tribes ceded millions 
of acres of land in exchange for the guarantee that the 
federal government would protect the tribes' right to self­
govemment. From the early 1800s on, the Supreme Court 
has repeatedly affirmed the fundamental principle that 
tribes retain inherent sovereignty over their members and 
their territory. 
Beginning with the decision in Oliphan t v. Suquamish 
Indian Tribe in 1978 and with increasing frequency in 
recent years, the Supreme Court has steadily chipped away 
at this fundamental principle, both by restricting tribal juris­
diction and by extending state jurisdiction. These decisions 
by the Supreme Court have made this priority more relevant 
than ever and have led to a Tribal Sovereignty Protection 
Initiative in partnership with the National Congress of 
American Indians (NCAI) and tribes nationwide to restore 
the traditional principles of inherent tribal sovereignty 
where those have been undermined and to safeguard the 
core of sovereignty that remains. 
This Initiative consists of three components. The first 
component is the Tribal Supreme Court Project, the focus of which is to monitor cases potentially headed to the Supreme 
Court and those which actually are accepted for review. 
When cases are accepted, the Tribal Supreme Court Project 
helps to ensure that the attorneys representing the Indian 
interests have all the support they need and to coordinate 
the filing of a limited number of strategic amicus briefs. A 
second component of the Initiative is to weigh in on judicial 
nominations at the lower court and the Supreme Court 
levels. Finally, there is a legislative component to fight bills 
that are against tribal interests and to affirmatively push 
legislation to overturn adverse Supreme Court declsions. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is a joint project staffed 
by the Native American Rights Fund and the National 
Congress of American Indians. The Tribal Supreme Court 
Project is based on the principle that a coordinated and 
structured approach to Supreme Court advocacy is neces­
sary to protect tribal sovereignty -the ability of Indian 
tribes to function as sovereign governments- to make their 
own laws and be ruled by them. Early on, the Tribal 
Supreme Court Project recognized the U.S. Supreme Court 
as a highly specialized institution, with a unique set of pro­
cedures that include complete discretion on whether it will 
hear a case or not, with a much keener focus on policy con­
siderations than other federal courts. The Tribal Supreme 
Court Project established a large network of attorneys who 
specialize in practice before the Supreme Court along with 
attorneys and law professors who specialize in federal Indian 
law. The Tribal Supreme Court Project operates under the 
theory that if Indian tribes take a strong, consistent, coordi­
nated approach before the Supreme Court, they will be able 
to reverse, or at least reduce, the on-going erosion of tri!bal 
sovereignty by Justices who appear to lack an understanding 
of the foundational principles underlying federal Indian law 
and who are unfamiUar with the practical challenges facing 
tribal governments. 
In 2013, the primary focus for the Tribal Supreme Court 
Project has been fixed on Michigan v. Bay Mill�a case 
granted review by the Court even though the United States 
had filed a brief recommen ding that cert be denied. 
Although this litigation should be about the merits of Bay 
Mills' claims under the Michigan Indian Land Claims 
Settlement Act to conduct gaming on lands acquired with 
settlement funds-it is not. In its current posture before 
the Court, the State of Michigan used this case to mount a 
full frontal attack on tribal sovereign immunity and the 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
authority of states to regulate "gaming activity" under the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act {IGRA) . The State of 
Alabama, joined by fifteen other states, and the State of 
Oklahoma filed amicus briefs in support of Michigan. 
On the merits, Michigan asked the Court to examin e 
·'IGRA as a whole" to 6nd Congressional intent to waive 
tribal sovereign Immunity or, in the alternative, to overrule 
Santa Ciara Pueblo to allow the lower courts to apply a "le� 
strict standard" when considering whether legislation such 
as IGRA abrogates tribal sovereign immunity. If the statu­
tory arguments are not successful, the state is asking the 
Court to recognize that tribal sovereign immunity "is a 
federal common law doctrine" created by this Court and 
subject to adjustment by this Court. Thus, according to 
Michigan, the Court should narrowly read Kiowa as a ·con­
tract-based ruling" and (at the extreme) hold that a tribe's 
immunity is limited to its on-reservation governmental 
functions. With the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity 
and the authority of states under IGRA on the table, this 
case has become high-stakes Litigation for Indian tribes 
across the country. Oral argument was held in December 
2013. 
Generall y, the Court appeared to accept the fact that 
Michigan or the federal government could resolve the matter 
by initiating criminal proceedings against the individuals 
operating or working at the casino, but questioned their 
efficacy. Bay Mills conceded (as it did in regard to arbitra­
tion) that both the Ex Pa.rte Young and criminal prosecution 
options were available remedies that could be pursued by 
the State. Bay Mills reminded the Court that the casino is 
currently closed and that the parties are currently in the 
process of renegotiating their state-tribal gaming compact 
where the State can bargain for additional remedies. 
However, several Justices appeared to view tribal sovereign 
immunity as a hurdle to any potential remedy. 
Through out the argument, various Justices noted several 
ways by which the Court could modify the doctrine of tribal 
sovereign immunity. Justice Kennedy, observing the unusual 
procedural posture of the case, propoSl!d a ruHng that would 
limit Kiowa so as to make the tribal sovereign immunity 
defense unavailable in the context of Indian gaming. Other 
Justices questioned whether Indian tribes should enjoy 
greater sovereign immunity than States or foreign nations. 
Justice Ginsburg proposed making a distinction between 
Annua l Report 2013 governmental and commercial (off-reservation) activity, 
whereby the latter would not be covered by tribal sovereign 
immunity. Michigan argued that the Court could either 
modify /(jowa on this governmental-versus-commercial 
distinction, or simply distinguish Kiowa on the basis that 
States are different-States are constitu tional sovereigns 
entitled to be treated differently than ordinary business 
plaintiffs. 
Finally, the Court discussed whether it should modify the 
doctrine of tribal sovereign immunit y, or whether, in Line 
with Kiowa, once again defer any changes to Congress. 
A majority of the Justices, including Chief Justice Roberts, 
expressed a belief in the inherent power of the Court to 
modify tribal sovereign immunity despite its holding in 
Kiowa. A decision is expected in March/April 2014. 
In July 2013, in coordination with the National Indian 
Child Welfare Association (NICWA) and NCAI, NARF 
flied a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of Veronica Brown 
(Baby Veronica) in the U.S. Federal District Court for the 
District of South Carolina. Two years ago, the South 
Carolina Family Court held best interest hearings and deter­
mined that it was in Veronica's best interest to be with her 
father, Dusten Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation. 
At that time, the state court determined that he was a fit and 
loving parent, and as a result, the South Carolina Supreme 
Court transferred custody to Mr. Brown. However, in June 
2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision in 
Adoptive Couple v. Baby Gi.rl, reversing and remanding the 
case back to the South Carolina courts based on its determi­
nation that the provisions of ICWA do not to apply to thi s 
case. In July 2013, the South Carolina Supreme Court 
issued a controversial order to the state's family court calling 
for an expedited transfer of custody to the South Carolina­
based adoptive couple without a hearing of best interest for 
Veronica. It is standard procedure that adoption proceedings 
reqwre a hearing to determine the best interest of the child 
in advance of any transfer of custody proceeding, an essen­
tial step the South Carolina Supreme Court failed to take, 
thus denying Veronica the right to have her current best 
interests considered. 
The federal dfatrict court denied without prejudice 
NARF's motion for a temporary restraining order against 
the South Carolina Family Court, and Judge Martin issued 
an order transferring custody of Veronica to the Adoptive Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
Couple. As pre-trial matters moved forward in our case, 
NARF closely monitored developments in the South 
CaroUna courts (e.g. criminal charges and extradition 
requests against Dusten Brown), and the subsequent pro­
ceedings in the Oklahoma courts and the Cherokee Nation 
courts. In the end, the Oklahoma courts domesticated 
Judge Martin's order, and in September 2013, Veronica was 
transferred to the custody of Adoptive Couple. Although 
appeals through the Oklahoma courts remained, in October 
2013, Dusten Brown announced his decision to end the 
custody battle. In conformity with the father's decision and 
with the best interests of Veronica in light of these develop­
ments, NARF filed a voluntary dismissal of the federal civil 
rights complaint. This matter is now closed. 
The research objective of the Judicial Selection Project 
evaluates the records of federal court judicial nominees on 
their knowledge of Native American issues. The Project's 
analysis and conclusions are shared with tribal leaders and 
federal decision-makers in relation to their decision whether 
to support or oppose a particular judicial nomination. Given 
the number of federal court cases involving Native American 
issues, the Project works with the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
Committee to ensure that all nominees are asked about their 
experience with Indian tribes and their understanding of 
federal Indian law during confirmation proceedings. 
As part of its outreach to Indian country, the Obama 
Administration continues to seek the names of quallfied 
Native American attorneys, tribal court judges and state 
court judg·es who are interested in being considered for 
vacancies on the federal bench. In September 2013, 
Annua l Report 2013 President Obama announced his nomination of Diane ]. 
Humetewa, an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, 
to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. 
Ms. Humetewa is a welJ-qualified Native American nominee 
who served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona 
from 2007-2009. Prior to her appointment as U.S. 
Attorney, she served as Counsel to the Deputy Attorney 
General and as Senior Litigation Counsel within the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. From 1993 to 1996, she was Deputy 
Counsel for the United States Senate Committee 0111 Indian 
Affairs for the Chairman, Senator John McCain. 
NARF was also invited to the White House for the 
President's announcement of thre.e nominations to fill 
vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit-sometimes referred to as the second most powerful 
court in the United States. Through the work of the Tribal 
Supreme Court Project, NARF has worked closely with one 
of the nominees, Patricia Millett, in her capacity as a partner, 
head of the Supreme Court Practice, and co-leader of the 
National Appellate Practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & 
Feld, LLP NARF submitted a letter of support on her 
behalf to the Senate Judiciary Committee for her confirma­
tion. and in December 2013. the U.S. Senate confirmed 
Ms. Millett as a judge on the D.C. Circuit. 
Another part of NARF's work under this priority is the 
environmental law and policy initiative. NARF has played 
a key role in the implementation of federal environmental 
law and policy that recognizes tribal governments as the pri­
mary regulators and enforcers of the federal environmental 
laws on Indian lands. After several years of fruitful partner­
ship, NARF has recently begun representing NCAI on 
climate change matt,ers. Climate change is one of the most 
challenging issues facing the world today. Its effects on 
indigenous peoples throughout the world are acute and will 
only get worse. The effects are especially pronounced in 
Alaska where as many as 184 Alaska Native villages are 
threatened with removal. NARF. in addition to working 
with some of its present clients on this issue, previously 
worked with National Tribal Environmental Council 
(NTEC) on comprehensive foderal climate change legisla­
tion. NTEC, NARF, NCAI and the National Wildlife 
Federation worked together and created a set of Tribal 
Principles and worked with national environmental organi­
zations on detailed legislative proposals. Unfortunately, 
these efforts stalled in Congress. Native American Right s Fund 
Federal Recogn ition of Tribal Status 
The second category of NARF's work under this priority 
is federal recognition of tribal status. NARF currently rep­
resents Indian communities who have survived intact as 
identifiable Indian tribes but who are not federally 
recognized. Tribal existence does not depend on federal 
recognition, but recognition is necessary for a government­
to-government relationship and the receipt of many federal 
services. 
In 1997, the Branch of Acknowledgment and Research 
(BAR) placed tlhe Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of 
Montana federal recognition petition on active review status. 
In 2000 the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs (AS-IA) 
pubUshed a PreUminary Determination in favor of recogni­
tion. A technical assistance meeting was held with the Office 
of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) to outUne a program of 
action to strengthen the petition prior to the fmal determi­
nation. Substantial work was done to strengthen the Tribe's 
petition and the final submissions were made in 2005. 
Active consideration of the Tribe's new material began in 
August 2007, and OFA conducted a three week site visit in 
October 2007. OFA had previously indicated it would 
reach a final determination by the end of calendar 2007. 
This deadline was not met; the date was moved to the end 
of July 2008. Before that date arrived, the AS-IA granted 
OFA new deadUnes of January 2009 and then July 2009. 
OFA granted itself an extension of time to September 2009, 
and then a further extension to October 2009. In October 
2009, the Acting AS-IA issued a Final Determination 
against recognition of the Tribe, overrullng the decision in 
the Preliminary Determination. The stated rat ionale for 
Final Determination was the unwillingness to go along 
with the "departures from precedent" which the previous 
AS-IA found to be justified by historical circumstances. 
In February 2010, the Tribe filed a Request for 
Reconsideration with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals 
(IBIA). The IBIA allowed interested parties, if any, to file 
opposition briefs by July 2010. No one filed an opposition 
brief. 
In June 2013, the IBIA affirmed the negative Final 
DetermJnation. However, it referred five legal questions to 
the Secretary of the Interior (SOI). In an important devel­
opment after the IBIA decision, and before our July 2013 
comments, in June 2013 the AS-IA made an announcement 
of "Consideration of Revision to Acknowledgment Regulations" along with preliminary discussion draft regula­
tions which propose major changes in the regu lations. In 
light of this announcement, we urged the SOI to request the 
AS-IA to suspend consideration of the Final Determ ination 
pending completion of the revision process as the proposed 
amendments are very significant. We submitted extensive 
comments on the draft regulations in September 2013. 
In September 2013, the SOI ruled on the legal issues 
which we had raised in the IBIA and which had been 
referred to the SOI. The SOI referred all five questions back 
to the AS-IA. stating, "The allegations in these grounds 
suggest that further review by your office would ensure that 
the Department's final decision in this matter benefits from 
a full analysis and comports with notions of a full and fair 
evaluation of the Little Shell petition." The SOI requested 
the AS-IA to consider this request as well. Pending is the 
Tribe's request to place their petition on suspension pending 
completion of the process to amend the acknowledgment 
regulations. The Tribe continues to pursue legislative recog­
nition 
After years of preparing the necessary historical, legal, 
genealogical and anthropological evidence to fully docu­
ment its petition for federal acknow ledgment, the 
Pamunkey Indian Tribe, located on the Pamunkey Indian 
Reservation, Virginia, filed its petition with the Office of 
Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) in October 2010. The 
Tribe received OFA's letter of Technical Assistance (TA) in 
April 2011 and a response to the TA letter was filed in July 
2012. In late July 2012, OFA informed the Tribe that its 
petition was moved to the top of the "Ready" List, and active 
consideration commenced August 2012. 
The Pamunkey Indian Tribe is the only tribe located in 
Virginia to have filed a fully documented recognition peti­
tion. EstabUshed no later than 1646, the Tribe's Reservation 
is located next to the Pamunkey River, and adjacent to King 
William County. The Rieservation comprises approximately 
1.200 acres and is the oldest inhabited Indian reservation in 
America. NARF has represented the Tribe in this effort 
since 1988 and now is co-counsel on this matter. 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
''American Indians are this country's first scientists, a fact that is often overlooked 
by contemporary America in general and the scientific community in particular. 
As Ind igenous peoples walked through history on their respective cultural roads 
of life, they formulated sophisticated bodies of traditional knowledge, some 
points of which converge with mainstream science. They were intimately famDiar 
with their environm ent and knew where they stood in the universe. In 
Indigenous thought, life is viewed holisticall y and for them sdence is but a 
strand that is interwoven into a vast, delicately balanced ecological system in 
which everyone and everything is connected and interdependen t. For them, 
science did not stand separate from life. " 
-Henrietta Mann, Cheyenne 
Annua l Report 2013 Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
Throughout the process of European conquest and colo­
nization of North America, Indian tribes experienced a 
steady diminishment of their land base to a mere 2.3 percent 
of its original size. Currently, there are approximately 55 
millJon acres of Indian-controlled land in the continentaJ 
United States and about 44 million acres of Native-owned 
land in Alaska. An adequate land base and control over 
natural resources are central components of economic self­
sufficiency and self-determinati on, and as such, are vital to 
the very existence of tribes. Thus, much of NARF's work 
involves the protection of tribal natural resources. 
Protection of Indian Lands 
Without a sufficient land base, tribal existence is difficult 
to maintain. Thus NARF helps tribes establish ownership 
and control over lands which are rightfully theirs. 
NARF has been retained by the Eastern Shoshone Tribe 
(EST) of the Wind River Indian Reservation to analyze the 
Surplus Land Act of March 3, 1905, and other legislation 
and cases, to determine their implications for the bound­
aries of the Reservation. 
The EST and Northern Arapaho 'Ifibe cooperated in an 
appUcation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(US EPA) for delegation of "treatment in the same manner 
as a state" (TAS) in the administration of certain Clean Air 
Act programs. A decision supporting delegation will require 
that US EPA determine the location of the boundaries of 
the Reservation. The TAS Application has been published 
by US EPA and they have received comments. The Tribes 
filed their Response to the comments in March 2010. US 
EPA requested a written opinion from the Department of 
the Interior on the boundaries which has been completed 
and forwarded to the US EPA. US EPA issued its Approval 
of Application Submitted by Eastern Shoshone Tribe and 
Northern Arapaho Tribe for Treatment in a Similar Manner 
as a State Under the Clean Air Act in December 2013. That 
decision determined that the boundaries of the Wind River 
Reservation were not altered by the Surplus Land Act of 
March 3, 1905. Wyoming has indicated that it will appeal 
EPA's decision if not altered. 
NARF represents the Hualapai lndfan Tribe of Arizona in 
preparing and submitting four applications for the transfer 
of 7 parcels of land owned in fee by the Tribe into trust status. The Tribe is located on the south rim of the Grand Canyon 
in Arizona, and claims a boundary that runs to the center of 
the Colorado River. The applications have been submitted 
to the BIA and await its response prior to being passed to 
the U.S. Interior Department's SoUcitor for a PreUminary 
Title Opinion on the parcels. The Regional Solicitor in 
Phoenix recently issued a Preliminary Title Opinion (PTO) 
on one of the Applications. We are working with a Title 
Company to cure any concerns identified in the PTO. 
In addition, NARF assisted the Tribe with the transfer of 
lands gifted to the Tribe at Challa Canyon Ranch. Because 
there were title concerns. NARF prepared a trust which the 
Tribe adopted and into which the lands were transferred. In 
addition, we are working on having these lands taken into 
trust, but the United States will not take the lands into trust 
until title to the Ranch has been cleared of any claim arising 
from questions related to transfer of title to the Tribe from a 
private trust. NARF, working with a local firm, successfully 
accomplished a series of transfers of ti tJe to the lands to clear 
title to the Ranch. The Petition for transfer of these lands 
into trust has been filed with the BIA. 
In Akiachak Native Commun ity, et al. v. Department of 
lnterio1; et al, the Akiachak Native Community, et al., rep­
resented by NARF. brought sujt in the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Columbia seeking judicial review of 25 
C.FR. Part 151 as it pertains to federally-recognized Tribes 
in Alaska. This federal regulation governs the procedures 
used by Indian Tribes and individuals when requesting tl1e 
Secretary of the Interior to acquire title to land in trust on 
their behalf. The regulation bars the acquisition of land in 
trust in Alaska other than for the MetlakatJa Indian 
Community or its members. After full briefing, but nearly 
three years of no action by the federal court, the case was 
transferred to Judge Rudolph Contreras. Judge Contreras 
issued an Order in April 2012 requesting that the federal 
government respond to six additional questions in a supple­
mental brief. The government filed its supplemental brief in 
July 2012 and Plaintiff Akiachak Native Community filed 
its reply brief in August 2012. 
In March 2013, an Order was issued by Judge Contreras, 
granting Plaintiffs complete relief on all of their claims -a 
major victory for Alaska Tribes. Briefing on remedies was 
concluded and a Memorandum Order was entered in 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
September 2013 denying the State of Alaska's motion for 
reconsideration, and severing and vacating Part 1 of 25 
C.FR. 151. The State is expected to appeal. 
Water Rights 
The culture and way of life of many indigenous peoples 
are inextricably tied to their abor iginal habitat. For those 
tribes that still maintain traditional ties to the natural world, 
suitable habitat is required in order to exercise their treaty­
protected hunting, fishing, gathering and trapping rights 
and to sustain their relationships with the animals, plants 
and fish that comprise their aboriginal habitats. 
Establishing tribal rights to the use of water Jn the arid 
wec;tern United States continues to be a major NARF 
priority. Tlhe goal ofNARF's Indian water rights work is to 
secure allocations of water for present and future needs for 
specific Indian tribes represented by NARF and other west­
ern tribes generally. Under the precedent established by the 
Supreme Court in 1908 in Winten v. United Stater and con­
ftrmed in 1963 in Arizona v. California, Indian tribes are 
entitled under federal law to sufficient water for present and 
future needs, with a priority date at least as early as the 
establishment of their reservations. These tribal reserved 
water rights are superior to all state-recognized water rights 
created after the tribal priority date. Such a date will in 
most cases give tribes valuable senior water rights in the 
water-short west. Unfortunately, many tribes have not uti­
lized their reserved water rights and most of these rights are 
unadjudicated or unquantified. The major need in each 
case is to define or quantify the amount of water to which 
each tribe is entitled through litigation or out-of-court 
settlement negotiations. Tribes are generally able to claim 
water for any purpose which enables the Tribe's reservation 
to serve as a permanent homeland. 
NARF, together with co-counsel, represents the Agua 
Caliente Band of CahuilJa Indians in a lawsuit filed in May 
2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of 
California, asking the Court to declare the existence of the 
Tribe's water rights as the senior rights in the Coachella 
VaJley under federal law, to quantify these rights, and to pre­
vent CoachelJa Valley Water District and Desert Water 
Agency from further in juring the Tribe, its members and rec;­
idents in surrounding communities throughout the Valley by 
impairing the quantity and quality of water in the aquifer. 
Annua l Report 2013 The water districts import and then fail to adequately 
treat substantially lower quality water from the Colorado 
River and inject that water into the aquifer. The recharge 
water, which contains higher total dissolved solids, nitrates, 
pesticides, and other contaminants, is re-injected into the 
Coachella ValJey aquifer at a facility close to the Tribe's 
lands. Thus, the groundwater in the Western Coachella 
Valley, including the water below the Agua Caliente 
Reservation, which includes the cities of PaJm Springs, 
Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, and Thousand Palms, is 
being polluted at a faster rate than the aquifer down-valley. 
The judge in the federal district court in Riverside, CA, 
has set the initial scheduling conference between the parties 
for January 2014. The structure for the Litigation wilJ be 
discussed with the judge at that time, and a scheduling order 
entered by the court. 
The Klamath Tribes' time immemorial priority date water 
rights to support the Tribes' treaty hunting, fishing, trap­
ping, and gathering rights were confirmed in the Final 
Order of Determination (FOD) issued by the Oregon 
Water Resources Department (OWRD) in the Klamath 
Basin Adjudication (KBA) in March 2013. For the first 
time ever, the Tribes were able to enforce their water rights 
during the 2013 irrigation season. OWRD's determination 
of the Tribes' rights, as well as all other water rights asserted 
in the KEA. is now subject to judicial review in the KJamath 
County Circuit Court in Klamath Falls, Oregon. 
In Summer and Fall 2013, the Tribes successfully defended 
against the Upper Klamath Basin irrigators' attempts to halt 
enforcement of the Tribes' water rights. In the next step of 
the judicial review phase, parties who dispute OWRD's 
determinations in the FOD have the opportunity to file 
exceptions to the FOD with the Klamath County Circuit 
Court. Under the current schedule exceptions must be Bled 
with the Court by March 3, 2014, but the State of Oregon 
has Bled a motion with the Court requesting an extension of 
that deadline to May 2014. 
Following the widespread curtailment of water use by 
Upper Basin irrigators and other junior water users during 
the 2013 irrigation season, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden ini­
tiated a series of meetings among the Klamath Tribes, Upper 
Basin lrrigators, and federal and state representa tives to Native American Right s Fund 
explore settlement opportuni­
ties, which resulted in an 
Agreement in Principle (AJP) .in 
December 2013. In the AIP 
the parties agree to continue 
good-faith negotiations with 
the goal of reaching a Final 
Agreement consistent with the 
AIP principles in early 2014. 
The four stated goals of the AlP 
are: to support the economic 
interests of the Klamath Tribes; 
to provide a stable, sustainable 
basis for the ,continuation of 
agriculture in the Upper 
Klamath Basin; to manage and 
restore riparian corridors along 
streams that flow into Upper 
Klamath Lake; and, to resolve 
water rights clajms and contests 
in the Klamath Basin 
Adjudication. Negotiations directed toward developing a 
Final Agreement are ongoing. 
After almost 30 years of advocacy, the Tule River Indian 
Tribe, represented by NARF. successfully settled its water 
rights in November 2007 by signing a Settlement 
Agreement with water users on the South Fork Tule River of 
CaLifomia. The Settlement Agreement secures a domestic, 
municipal, industrial, and commerciaJ water supply for the 
Tribe. The Tribe now seeks federal legislation to ratify the 
Settlement Agreement and authorize appropr iations to 
develop the water rights through the creation of water infra­
structure and reservoirs on the Tule Reserva tion. Bills intro­
duced in the U.S. House and Senate in 2007, 2008, and 
2009 ilid not pass. With the present Congress, we are once 
again engaged in strategy meetings with the CaLifornia 
Congressional delegation regariling the possible introduc­
tion of a water settlement bill in calendar year 2014. 
Additionally, we are continuing work with the 
federal Bureau of Reclamation on necessary studies for the 
feasibiLity and design of the Tribe's water storage project. 
In June 2006, the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas, represented 
by NARF. filed a federal court Lawsuit in an effort to enforce 
express promises made to the Tribe to build a Reservoir }ohn &hohawk {center} with former NA.RP attorneys and 
former staff. 
Project. The Nemaha Brown Watershed Joint Board # 7, 
the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, and the State of Kansas made 
these promises to the Tribe over a decade ago. In the inter­
vening years these parties have been actively developing the 
water resources of the watershed, resulting in the near deple­
tion of the Tribe's senior federal water rights in the drainage. 
According to the Envfronrnental Protection Agency, the 
water supply for the Reservation is in violation of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act of 197 4. The Kickapoo people are 
unable to safely drink, bathe or cook with tap water. There 
is not enough water on the reservation to provide basic 
municipal services to the community and the Tr.ibe 
is not even able to provide local schools with reLiable, 
safe running water. The fire department cannot provide ade­
quate fire protection du1e to the water shortage. The pro­
posed Reservoir Project is the most cost effective and reliable 
means by which the Tribe can improve the water supply. 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
The U.S., the State and the local watershed district alJ 
concede the existence of the Tribe's senior Indian reserved 
water rights; the real issue is the amount of water needed to 
satisfy the Tribe's rights, and the source or sources of that 
water. The Tribe and the US are also discussing funding to 
quantify the Tribe's water dghts. 
In March 2011, the watershed district rejected a 
Condemnation Agreement that the State and Tribe had 
approved. That agreement created the mechanism for 
condemning the property for the water storage project. 
NARF then succeeded in restructuring the litigation to 
place an immediate focus on discovery against the watershed 
district and on getting the condemnation dispute resolved 
by the federal court. We also continue to investigate the 
possibility of a comprehensive settlement of the water rights 
i�es in the case. 
Most recently, the federal court entered summary judg­
ment in favor of the watershed district on the question of 
whether a 1994 agreement obUgated the district to make its 
condemnation power available to aid the Ti-ibe in acqufring 
the land for the water storage project area. The Tribe is now 
evaluating its options, including discussions with the 
Interior Department and the State of Kansas to find an 
alternative means of securing the land rights for the project. 
NARF prepared an analysis of the options the Bad River 
Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Indians has for protecting 
the quantity and quality of the waters of its Reservation. 
The Tribe's Reservation is located in the State of Wisconsin 
which uses a riparian system for allocation of the uses of the 
surface waters within the State. Of particular concern to the 
Tribe are recent amendments by the State lto remove or sig­
nificantly relax water related environmental protections 
contained in state Laws. These amendments were intended 
to facilitate the development and operation of a proposed 
taconite (low grade iron) mine on the headwaters of the 
rivers that feed the Bad River Reserva tion. NARF is work­
ing with the Tribe to request that the United States support 
the Tribe in the protection of the Tribe's treaty reserved 
water rights. 
NARF has represented the Nez Perce Tribe in Idaho in its 
water rights claims in the Snake River Basin Adjudication 
(SRBA) both litigation and settlement phases for over 16 
Annua l Report 2013 years. In 2001 Congress enacted and the President signed 
the Snake River Settlement Act. We contin ue to work with 
the Tribe, on a very limited basis, to secure final approval of 
the settlement by the state water court, and on the federal 
appropriations process. Additionally, we are representing the 
Tribe in the drafting and negotiations with the United 
States, the State and private water interests in the Final 
Unified Decree that wJll be the capstone document closing 
the SRBA. With the Court, and one of the special masters, 
we have worked through many drafts of the Final Unified 
Decree with an eye toward resolving all objections to the 
text. It is now anticipated that the Final Unified Decree wilJ 
be signed by the judge in 2014. 
Protection of Hunting and Fishing Rights in Alaska 
The subsistence way of life is essential for the physical and 
cultural survival of Alaska Natives. As important as Native 
hunting and fishing rights are to Alaska Natives' physical, 
economk, traditional and cultural existence, the State of 
Alaska has been and continues to be reluctant to recognize 
the importance of the subsistence way of life. 
In State v. Norton, the State of Alaska flied a lawsuit in the 
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia In 2005, 
challenging a federal agency final rule implementing the 
mandate in a prior Alaska Native subsistence case, 
john v. United States. The prior case, in which NARF rep­
resented Katie John, an Alaska Native, established that the 
United States must protect subsistence uses of fisheries in 
navigable waters where the United States possesses a 
reserved water right. In this new lawsuit, the State chal­
lenges the FederaJ agencies' implementation of the mandate 
by arguing that the rieserved waters doctrine requires a quan­
tification of waters necessary to fulfill specific purposes. 
Katie John moved for limited intervention for purposes 
of filing a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispen­
sable party. The United States' request to transfer the case 
to the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska was 
granted. The case was then consolidated with John v. 
Norton. The issues: in the two cases were bifurcated for 
briefing with the State's claims addressed first. In 2007 the 
court upheld the agency's rule making process identifying 
navigable waters in Alaska that faU within federal jurisdic­
tion for purposes of federal subsistence priority. 
In Katie john v. Norton, Katie John, represented by NARF. Native American Right s Fund 
filed a lawsuit in 2005 in the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Alaska 
challenging Federal Agencies' final rule 
implementing the prior Katie John man­
date as being too restrictive in its scope. 
Katie John alleged that the Federal agen­
cies should have included Alaska Native 
allotments as public lands and that the 
federal government's interest in water 
extends upstream and downstream from 
Conservation Units established under the 
Alaska National Interest Lands 
Conservation Act. The State of Alaska 
intervened and challenged the regulations 
as Ulegally extending federal jurisdiction 
to state waters. In 2009 the court upheld 
the agencies' !final rule as reasonable. 
While rejecting Katie John's claim that NARF hosted students from Dartmouth. 
the agency had a duty to identify all of its 
federally-reserved water rights in 
upstream and downstream waters, the 
court stated that the agency could do so at some future time 
if necessary to fulfill the purposes of the reserve. The case 
was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit where oral argument was held in July 2011. 
In July 2013, a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals affirmed the district court's decisions upholding the 
1999 Final Rules promulgated by the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to implement part 
of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act 
concerning subsistence fishing and hunting rights. 
As threshold issues, the panel held that the Secretaries 
appropriately used notice-and -comment rulemaking, rather 
than adjudicat ion, to identify whose waters are �public 
lands" for the purpose of determining the scope of the Act's 
rural subsistence policy; and that in construing the term 
"public lands," the Secretaries were entitled to "some defer­
ence." The panel concluded that, in the 1999 Rules, the 
Secretaries applied Katie John I and the federal reserved 
water rights doctrine in a principled manner. The panel 
held that it was reasonable for the Secretaries to decide that 
the "public lands" subject to the Act's rural subsistence 
priority included the waters within and adjacent to federal 
reservations; and reserved water rights for Alaska Native Settlement allotments were best determined on a case-by-
case basis. 
The State filed a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review 
in November 2013. Appellees requested and were granted a 
45 day extension in which to file their response until 
January 2014. The United States again requested a 30 day 
extension to and including February 2014. 
In Native ViUages of £yak, Tatitlek, Chenega, Nanwalek, 
and Port Graham v. Evans, NARF represents five Chugach 
villages that sued the Secretary of Commerce to estabLish 
aboriginal rights to their traditional use areas on the Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS) of Alaska, in Cook Inlet and the 
Gulf of Alaska. In 2002 the federal district court ruled 
against the Chugach. NARF appealed to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which in 2004 en bane vacat­
ed the district court's decision and remanded for determina­
tion of whether the Tribes can establish aboriginal rights to 
the areas. After denials of summary judgment motions on 
the issue, trial on whether these Tribes hold aboriginal rights 
to hunt and Eish in federal waters was held in August 2008. 
In August 2009 the court held that although the five 
Chugach Tribes had established that they had a "territory" 
and had proven they had used the waters in question, the 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
Tribes could not hold aboriginal rights as a matter of law. 
The Chugach appealed to the Ninth Circuit en bane panel 
which retained jurisdiction over the case. Oral argument 
was heard by the en bane panel in September 2011. In July 
2012, a 6-5 majority of the Ninth Circuit en bane panel 
affirmed the district court's ruling that the Tribes failed to 
establish entitlement to non-exclusive aboriginal rights on 
the OCS. 
The majority concluded that the Villages had satisfied the 
'"continuous use and occupancy" requirement of the test for 
aboriginal rights, which is measured in accordance with the 
particular ways of life, customs, and habits of the tribe seek­
ing to estabUsh aboriginal rights. The majority determined 
that the district court's findings that the Villages' ancestors 
had hunted and fished on the OCS seasonally and while 
traveling to outer islands was consistent with their way of 
life as marine hunters and fisherman, and thus satisfied this 
requirement. 
However, the majority concluded that the Villages did 
not satisfy the "exclusivity� requirement of the test. 
Exclusivity is established when a tribe shows it used and 
occupied a territory to the exclusion of other Indian 
groups. The majority reje<:ted the argument that the lack 
of evidence that other groups hunted and fished in the 
claimed OCS territory established exclusivity. The majority 
interpreted the district court's finding that neighboring 
tribes had likely fished and hunted on the periphery of the 
claimed 0 CS territory to constitute a finding that these 
other groups had likely fished and hunted within the 
claimed OCS territory. The majority also reUed on a state­
ment by the district court that the population of the ances­
tral villages was too low to have been able to exercise 
dominion and control over the claimed OCS area. 
Five judges signed on to a vigorous dissent which agreed 
with the majority that the Tribes had satisfied the continu­
ous use and occupancy requirement but strongly disagreed 
with the majority's conclusion that the exclusivity require­
ment was not satisfied. The dissent argued that exclusivity 
does not roquire the Tribes to show that as a theorotical mat­
ter, they could have repelled intruders from the claimed 
OCS area, as suggested by the district court's population 
finding. Rather, in the absence of evidence of use by others, 
case law requires only that the Villages show that they were 
Annua l Report 2013 the only group that used and occupied the area. The dissent 
engaged in a thorough and well-reasoned analysis of the 
district court's findings and the supporting evidence to con­
clude that tliis requirement had been satisfied with respect 
to at least some parts of the claimed OCS area. Thus, the 
dissent would have reversed and remanded with instructions 
to the district court to find, under the proper legal test, 
precisely where within the claimed area the Tribes have 
aboriginal rights. 
NARF filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. 
Supreme Court and cert was finally denied in October 
2013, ending the case. 
The Bering Sea Elders Group is an alliance of thirty-nine 
Yup'ik and lnupiaq villages that seeks to protect the sensitive 
ecosystem of the Bering Sea, the subsistence lifestyle, and 
the sustainable communities that depend on it. NARF has 
designed a comprehensive plan to help this group of Alaska 
Native villages in their efforts to protect the area and 
become more engaged in its management. Subsistence is 
the inherently sustainable Native philosophy of taking only 
what you need. There are often no roads and no stores in 
rural Alaska, and so no other group of people in the United 
States continues to be as intimately connected to the land 
and water and as dependent upon its vast natural resources 
as Alaska's indigenous peoples. 
NARF has been working with the Elders Group in their 
negotiations with the bottom trawl industry. These negoti­
ations have resulted in the creation of a Working Group 
which will study various issues including sea.floor habitat 
and subsistence uses of the area and make recommendations 
about changes that need to be made. The first Working 
Group meeting is currently being planned. 
Alaska's Bristol Bay region is home the largest wild salmon 
runs in the world. It is also home to the Yup'ik, Dena'ina, 
and Alutiiq people who depend on the sustainable salmon 
runs for their subsistence. In April 2013, NARF assisted in 
the creation of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay (UTBB). 
UTBB is a consortium of federally recognized tribes in the 
region. It was formed in order for tribes to directly address 
regional large-scale mining proposals threatening salmon 
rearing streams-such as the proposed Pebble Mine, which 
would sit on the headwaters of the largest salmon-producing Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
river in Bristol Bay. UTBB possesses a unique power, sepa­
rate from any other grassroots organization in Bristol Bay: it 
ls a polJtical subdivision of the tribes, exercising delegated 
tribal governmental powers. As such, UTBB exists under 
tribal law and is organized as a Section 7871 group-an IRS 
tax code provision granting tribes and their subdivisions 
treatment as states. Exercising its delegated governmental 
authority with NARF as legal counsel, UTBB has actively 
engaged the federal government in direct government-to­
government consultation on the proposed Pebble Mine 
development in Bristol Bay region, including a recent con­
sultation directly with Administrator Gina McCarthy of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
Climate Change Project 
After several years of fruitful partnership, NARF has 
recently begun representing NCAI on climate change mat­
ters. Climate change is one of the most challenging issues 
facing the world today. Its effects on indigenous peoples 
throughout the world are acute and will only get worse. The effects arc especially pronounced in Alaska where as many as 
184 Alaska Native villages are threatened with removal. 
NARF, in addition to working with some of its present 
clients on this issue, previously worked with National Tribal 
Environmental Council (NTEC) on comprehensive federal 
climate change legislation. NTEC, NARF. NCAI and the 
National Wildlife Federation worked together and created a 
set of Tribal Principles and worked with national environ­
mental organizations on detailed legislative proposals. 
Unfortunately, t11ese efforts stalled in the Congress. 
NARF and NTEC attended the United Nations 
Framework Convention on CUmate Change (UNFCCC) 
Summit -COP 15-in Copenhagen, Denmark in December 
2009. The purpose of the UNFCCC process ls to come up 
with an international treaty governing emissions of green­
house gases. 
NARF and NTEC also attended COP 16 in Cancun in 
December 2010. A Cancun Agreement was reached, Ukely

peoples and of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). There are safeguards calJ­
ing for "the full and effective participation" of indigenous 
peoples in Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and 
Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities and there are also 
some references to taking Into account traditional indige-
nous know ledge. 
At COP 17 in Durban, South Africa, November -
December 2011, the countries established a new Ad Hoc 
Working Group for Enhanced Action (ADP). The coun­
tries committed to adopt a universal legal agreement on cli­
mate change as soon as possible, but not later than 2015, to 
go into effect by 2020. Based on this commitment, a core 
of countries; led by the European Union agreed to a second 
commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol (to which the 
U.S. is not a party). In addrnon, the Green CUmate Fund, 
which is to be the major source of funding for international 
mitigation and adaptation activities was agreed to and can 
start receiving funding. But no progress was made regard­
ing an assessment of whether safeguards for indigenous 
rights are being implemented. 
At a two week session in Bonn in May 2012, the new 
ADP could not even agree on the agenda until the last day. 
Informal sessions were held in Bangkok, Thailand in August 
and September, 2012 to prepare for COP 18 which was held 
in Doha, Qatar in November and December, 2012. The 
outcome at Doha was generally anemic. A second period 
for the Kyoto Protocol was approved with weak emissions 
reduction commitments by countries accoll!nting for a mod­
est percentage of world-wide emissions. COP 18 resulted in 
nothing solid in the way of commitments from non-KP 
countries, and nothing as to financial commitments to 
developing countries. These are matters for the ADP in 
upcoming meetings. The can was kicked down the road 
once again. Further, Indigenous Peoples, along with other 
constituencies found their already limited rights to make 
interventions curtailed even more, as usually only 2-3 enti­
ties were allowed to speak. On a brighter note, the head of 
COP 18 attended an Indigenous caucus meeting and 
expressed support. The caucus asked in a letter that Qatar 
support a meeting between indigenous peoples and friendly 
states before COP 19 is held in Warsaw, Poland in 
Annua l Report 2013 The first meetings on the specifics of the new "protocol to 
be adopted by December 2015 were held in Bonn in 
April/May and June, 2013. NARF attended all of the April 
/May meeting and part of the June meeting on behalf of 
NCAI. NARF was the only one to make a brief statement 
on behalf of the .indigenous view-point at the April/May 
meeting. So far, the process is very slow and developed 
countries are spending a lot of time on general concepts, but 
no specific language has been proposed yet. In November 
2013, NARF attended COP 19 in Warsaw, Poland and the 
results were disappointing. Disturbingly, Poland only 
authorized a small percent of NG Os to attend. One indige­
nous organization requested 30 slots and only seven were 
approved. The main accomplishment of COP 19 was the 
approval of a loss and damage mechanism (though with no 
finding) which would address loss due to climate change. 
On a more positive note, the Indigenous Caucus met with 
the organizers of COP 20 to be held in Lima, Peru and were 
assured that ample attendance by Indigenous participants 
wou Id be approved and that a pre-meeting would be held 
between Indigenous representatives and friendly states just 
as had been done before COP 16 in Mexico and COP 17 in 
Durban, South Africa. Finally, the caucus also met with 
organizers for COP 21 in France who gave assurance of 
ample participation as well, though they did not commit to 
a pre-meeting. 
Global warming is wreaking havoc in Alaska. In recent 
years scientists have documented melting ocean ice, rising 
oceans, rising river temperatures, thawing permafrost, 
increased insect infestations, animals at risk and dying 
forests. Alaska Natives are the peoples who rely most on 
Alaska's ice, seas, marine mammals, fish and game for nutri­
tion and customary and traditional subsistence uses; they are 
thus experiencing the adverse impacts of global warming 
most acutely. In 2006, during the Alaska Forum on the 
Envfronment, Alaska Native participants described 
increased forest fires, more dangerous hunting, fishing and 
traveling conditions, vjsible changes in animals and plants, 
infrastructure damage from melting permafrost and coastal 
erosion, flercer winter storms, and pervasive unpredictabiUty. 
Virtually every aspect of traditional Alaska Native life 
is impacted . As noted in the Arctic Climate Impact Native American Right s Fund 
New NARF attorneys Sue Noe and Heather Whiteman 
Runs Him. 
Assessment of 2004, indigenous peoples are reporting that 
sea ice is decUning, and its quaUty and timing are changing, 
with important negative repercussions for marine hunters. 
Others are reporting that salmon are diseased and cannot be 
dried for winter food. There is widespread concern about 
caribou habitat diminishing as larger vegetation moves 
northward. Because of these and other dramatic changes, 
traditional knowledge is jeopardized, as are cultural struc­
tures and the nutritional needs of Alaska's Indigenous 
peoples. Efforts are continuing to convene Congress ional 
hearings on climate change impacts on indigenous peoples. 
In Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil, NARF 
represents the Native Village of Kivalina, which is a federally 
recogni2ed lndjan Tribe, and the City of Kivalina, which is 
an Alaskan municipality, in a suit filed on their own behalf 
and on behalf of all tribal members against defendants 
ExxonMobil Corp., Peabody Energy Corp., Southern 
Company, American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Co, Chevron Corp. and Shell Oil Co., among others. In total 
there are nine oil company defendants, fourteen electric 
power company defendants and one coal company defen­
dant. The suit claims damages due to the defendant com­
panies' contributions to global warming and invokes the 
federal common law of public nuisance. The suit also 
alleges a conspiracy by some defendants to mislead the pubUc 
regarding the causes and consequences of global warming. 
In October 2009, the District Court granted the 
Defendant's motion to dismiss on the basis that Kivalina's 
federal claim for nuisance is barred by the political question 
doctrine and for lack of standing under Article ill of the 
Constitution. 
In September 2012. the US Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit rejected the Tribe's appeal. The Court held, 
in a very short and cursory opinion, that the federal Clean 
Air Act defines the full scope of all federal remedies for air 
pollution and, since there is no monetary damages remedy 
under the Clean Air Act, there is no monetary damages 
remedy under federal common law. Writing a separate 
opinion, Judge Pro noted that the most recent case law from 
the Supreme Court -the Exxon Shipping case (i.e. Exxon 
Valdez oil spill case) , holds the opposite; in his concurr"ing 
opinion Judge Pro struggles to make sense of the law since 
older case law would deny Kivalina 's claims while Exxon 
Shipping says that a federal environmental statute does not 
bar a federal common law claim for monetary damages. 
Based on the separate opinion by Judge Pro, a petition 
for rehearing en bane was filed on October 5, 2012 but 
rejected. Plaintiffs filed a timely petition for a writ of 
certiorari before the Supreme Court but that petition was 
denied in May 2013.

Although basic human rights arc considered a universal 
and inaLlenable entitlement, Native Americans face an 
ongoing threat of having their rights underm ined by the 
United States governm ent, states and others who seek to 
limit these rights. Under the priority of the promotion of 
human rights, NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws 
which are designed to protect the rights of Native Americans 
to practice their traditional reHgion, to use their own lan­
guage and to enjoy their culture. NARF also works with 
Tribes to ensure the welfare of their children. In the inter­
national arena, NARF is active in efforts to negotiate decla­
rations on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
Religious Freedom 
Because religion is the foundation that holds Native com­
munities and cultures together, reUgious freedom is a NARF 
priority issue. 
In NARF's Sacred Places Project, NARF has partnered 
with the National Congress of American Indians and the 
Morningstar Institute to help ensure that various federal 
agencies with jurisdiction over federal lands are held 
accountable to their obligation to protect sacred places and 
provide meaningful access to tribal people wishing to use 
those places for traditional purposes. These efforts wiU 
include providing best practices analysis, as well as raising 
awareness of issues and different approaches that can be 
used to protect sacred places held by the federal govern­
ment. To the extent possible, analysis and practices learned 
from federal lands will also be compared for use on private 
and state-held lands. 
NARF also has written amicus briefs in select cases 
involving sacred places and laws pertaining to the continued 
ability of native people to exercise their religiol!ls and tradi­
tional cultural practices. For example, NARF wrote an 
arnicus brief in Yount v. Salazar, arguing that the govern­
ment was able to withdraw a million acres of land around 
the Grand Canyon from mining without violating the 
Establishment Clause of the Constitution . The Northern 
Ariwna Withdrawal will protect many sacred sites, trails, 
plants, and other cultural items from future mining claims 
if it is upheld. 
Legal work continues on a number of Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation (NAGPRA) implemen-tation is.sues. NARF continued a decade-long effort as a 
member of the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs to 
work out agreements and protocols with the Colorado Strate 
Historical Society for the repatriation and reburial of hun­
dreds of Native American human remains, both culturally 
affiUated and unaffiliated. Part of the work also involved the 
development of a protocol for the future identification and 
disposition of Native American remains disturbed on state 
or private lands, which specifies a process for consultation 
with interested tribes and for the reburial on site of those 
remains whenever possible. 
The massive Chuitna Coal project in Alaska threatens to 
destroy a vital salmon habitat stream that the Tyonek Native 
ViUage utilizes for subsistence fisheries. After agreeing to 
assist the Tribe in protecting its subsistence fisheries 
resources, legal research 'established that much more was at 
stake as recent field surveys and excavations found numerous 
house pits, cultural features, and religious remains in the 
project area. Under such circumstances the National 
Historic Preservation Act requires that the federal agency 
tasked with jurisdiction immediately contact the impacted 
Tribe to seek consultation regarding the protection of the 
historic resources. Under existing law Tyonek should be 
granted the opportunit:y to identify its concerns about 
historic properties, advise on the identification and evalua­
tion of historic properties, including those of traditional 
religious and cultural importance, articulate its views on the 
undertaking's effects on such properties, and participate in 
the resolution of adverse effects. NARF has engaged an 
expert and has been working with the Tribe's Council, the 
State Historic Preservation Office, the National Park Service 
and others to effectively engage the Army Corp of Engineers 
on National. Historic Preservation Act issues. NARF also 
met in Washington, D.C. with top agency personnel in 
October 2012 and received significant commitments from 
EPA, NOAA, Department of the Interior, NPS, NHPC, 
and the White House Counsel on Native American Affairs 
to monitor the process and ensure that tribal consultation is 
adhered to. 
NARF has been assisting the Denver area Native 
American community and interested tribes for almost a 
decade to give voice to the need to clean up and preserve a 
prominent geologic feature just to the northeast of Boulder, 
Colorado. Valmont Butte is an ancient volcanic uplift that 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
sits prominently on the outskirts of town, just overlooking 
the north fork of Boulder Creek. In pre-contact times it was 
the location of Ute and then Arapaho village sites. Use and 
occupation of the area is known to go back at least 10,000 
years in antiquity. The property, owned by the City of 
Boulder since 2000, is known to contain substantiaJ prehis­
toric materials, including burial areas. The Butte has also 
until recent years been the site of an active sweat lodge. 
There is an abandoned mJll on the property, and taiUngs 
from the fi�y-plus years of milUng activities are now 
contained on the eastern end of the property about forty 
acres in si2e. The City purchased the property to locate a 
composting facility or fire training center. The tribes and 
the local Native community successfully opposed these 
facilities. In recent years, the effort has been to monitor the 
development of the City's proposed cl ea nu p plan and also to 
secure a County landmark designation for the Butte and 
surrounding acreage. 
NARF represents the Kaibab Paiute Tribe in their dispute 
with the King County Water District and the Army Corps 
of Engineers who are preparing to build a dam over a burial 
ground that is known to contain the remains of almost 100 
people. The Water District and the Corps have not finished 
their study to determine exactly how many people are stiU 
buried there, and the Kaibab do not want the dam built or 
the reservoir filled until the full extent of the burials are 
known and steps can be taken to protect the site and the 
people under the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriat ion Act (NA GPRA). 
The Native American Rights Fund is part of a working 
group of Indian organizations and tribal leaders to address 
government intervention in the lives of Native people who 
work with or use eagle feathers in traditional ways. Since 
time-immem orial, the eagle and other raptor birds have 
been an integral part and intrinsic to the traditions, culture 
and religion of many tribes, pre-dating U.S. colonization. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and other feder­
al law enforcement agencies had been conducting raids, 
confiscations and interrogations on many Indian reserva­
tions and pow-wow events, in at least 14 states of the west­
ern United States under what purportedly is referred to as an 
"Eagle Feather Sting Operati on." 
Annua l Report 2013 The immediate purpose of these investigations by the 
FWS was to address the illicit sale of eagles and eagle parts 
and the poaching of eagles. However, the impact of these 
investigations has awakened fear that the U.S. government 
is once again encroaching upon tribal culture and religio us 
practices, to the point where the tribaJ cuJture and religion 
may be forced underground once again. 
The working group met with the FWS and the 
Department of Justice {DO] in 2009 to express tribal con­
cerns about raids that were conducted by the FWS, FBI and 
other law enforcement officials who seized feathers and 
demanded documentation. Under federal law, only Native 
people can possess eagle feathers through gifts or inheri­
tance, or from a government-run repository near Denver 
which issues permits specifically for individual birds or 
parts, generaJly after lengthy waits. 
As a result of this meeting, FWS and DOJ pledged to take 
action regarding their lack of effective outreach and educa­
tion to tribes on poUcies regarding the possession, use, gift­
ing and crafting of eagle feathers and other endangered 
birds. FWS proposed the development of a Tribal Advisory 
Group to work out long -term solutions to the issues that 
tribes raised. 
The National Congress of American Indians {NCAI) 
adopted a resolution supporting the establishment of Tribal 
Advisory Group to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Sel!'Vice in 
order to provide consultation on the policies, regulations 
and procedures for the acquisition, possession, gifting, 
crafting and use of eagles and other migratory birds by 
tribal members. It was also resolved that NARF shall serve 
as a central clearinghouse for the cases appertaining to the 
"Eagle Feather Sting Operation" being conducted by the 
FSW and other federal law enforcement agencies. NARF 
and NCAI continued meetings with the FSW and other 
federal law enforcement agencies to discuss and seek 
solutions as to the effects and impacts of eagle feather 
confiscations and to discuss the drafting of an all-inclusive 
bill to "fix" the gap between current law and administrative 
policies, regulations and procedures. 
As a result of these efforts, the Department of Justice 
announced in October 2012 a department-wide, internal 
policy regarding the enforcement of laws that affect the Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
abiUty of members of federally recognized Indian tribes to 
poss� or use eagle feathers. The policy provides that, con­
sistent with the Department of Justice's traditional exercise 
of its discretion, a member of a federally recognized tribe 
engaged only in the following types of conduct will not be 
subject to prosecution: possessing, using, wearing or carry­
ing federally protected birds, bird feathers or other bird 
parts (federally protected bird parts); traveling domestically 
with federally protected bird parts or, if tribal members 
obtain and comply with necessary permits, traveling inter­
nationally with such items; picking up naturally molted or 
fallen feathers found in the wild, without molesting or disturbing federally protected birds or their nests; giving or 
loaning federally protected bird parts to other members of 
federally recognized tribes, without compensation of any 
kind; exchanging federaUy protected bird parts for federally 
protected bird parts with other members of federally 
recognized tribes, without compensation of any kind; and 
providing feathers or other parts of federally protected birds 
to craftspersons who are members of federally recognized 
tribes to be fashioned into objects for the eventual use in 
tribal religious of cultural activities. 
NARF has also continued its representation of the Native 
American Church of North America in addressing issues 
concerning the sacramental use of peyote in their religious 
ceremonies. NARF has begun a project to research the 
impact of the peyote harvest decline in Texas on Native 
American Church members and to develop and support 
access to and the use of the holy sacrament, peyote, for our 
client, the Native American Church of North America. 
Indian Education 
During the 19th and into the 20th century, pursuant to 
federal policy, Native American children were forcibly 
abducted from their homes and put into Christian and 
government run boarding schools. The purpose was to '"civ­
ilize" Indians and to stamp out native culture. It was a delib­
erate policy of ethnocide and cultural genocide. Cut off 
from their families and culture, the children were punished 
for speaking their native language, banned from conducting 
traditional or cultural practices, shorn of traditional clothing 
and identity of their native culture, taught that their culture 
and traditions were evil and sinful, and that they should be 
ashamed of being Native American. Placed often far from 
home, they were frequently neglected or abused physically, 
sexually and psychologically. Generations of these children 
became the legacy of the federal Boarding School Policy. 
They were returned to their communities, not as the 
Christianized farmers that the Boarding School Policy envi­
sioned, but as deeply scarred humans lacking the skills, com­
munity, parenting, extended family, language, and cultural 
practices. of those who are raised in their cultural context. 
There has been scant recognition by the U.S. federal gov­
ernment that initiated and carried out this policy, and no 
acceptance of responsibility for the indisputable fact that its 
purpose was cultural genocide. There are no apparent 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
realistic legal avenues to seek redress or healing from the 
deep and enduring wounds inflicted both on the individuals 
and communities of tribal nations. Lawsuits by individuals 
have been turned aside, and unlike other countries that

The Boarding School Healing Project, directed by the 
National Native American Boarding School Healing 
Coalition, mission is to secure healing and reconciLlation 
among Native American individuals, farniUes, communities, 
tribes, Pueblos, and Alaskan villages victimized by over a 
century of documented boarding school human rights 
violations. Currently, the Project is primarily in a phase of 
conducting education and outreach, which has three general 
areas of focus at this time: ( 1) Indian Country, (2) Congress, 
and (3) Churches. Outreach in Indian country has been 
moving forward by givin& presentations at regional tribal 
organization meetings, as well as working with Indian 
Country media whenever available. We have also made 
contact with the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs' staff 
and are keeping that office informed of our work. Project 
staff have been meeting and teleconferenci ng with staff from 
both the House Native American Caucus and the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs. We will provide briefings to 
staff of members of each group, as requested, in order to 
create spheres of awareness among Congressi onal staff. 
We continue to work with representatives from the 
Council of Native American Ministries l n order to raise 
awareness among churches working in lndfan Country. We 
also presented to a multi-denominational audience at a 
briefing on the boarding schools sponsored by the Friends 
Committee on National Legislation (Quakers) in December 
2013 in Washington DC. We are also collaborating with 
the local Boulder Quaker chapter and Haverford College 
faculty on attempting to raise awareness and academ ic inter­
est in church investigation and admission of roles in the 
boarding school policy as a field of research. 
NARF is seeking and compiling r(!Search on transfer of

Annua l Report 2013 Recent developments mark a historical shift in Indian 
education law and policy by taking the fLrSt step in accom­
plishing "educational tribal sovereignty. " NARF, other 
Indian organizations and tribes have been advocating for sys­
temic changes to American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/ AN) 
education. Changes that would increase involvement of tribal 
governments, educators, parents, and elders in what Af./ AN 
students are taugh t, !how they are taught, who teaches them, 
and where they learn. Tribal control of these core issues can 
amount to educational tribal sovereignty. 
NARF represents the Tribal Education Departments 
National Assembly (TEDNA) , a national advocacy organi­
zation for tribal education departments and agencies 
(TEDs/TEAs) that works to strengthen the legal rights of 
tribes to control the formal education of tribal members. 
NARF started TEDNA in 2003 with a group of tribal 
education department directors from Indian tribes across 
the country. Since its inception, NARF has hosted National 
meetings with TEDNA to 1) identify obstacles impeding 
educational tribal sovereignty, 2) develop policy initiatives 
to address such obstacles, and 3) advocate and provide 
technical assistance on such policy initiatives. 
After over 20 years of work, NARF and TEDNA secured 
the first source of direct federal funding -$ 2 million -for 
tribal education departments ("TEDs") in the Labor, 
Health, and Human Services Fiscal Year 2012 
Appropriations Bill to be distributed by the U.S. 
Department of Education via a competitive grant process 
under a new State Tribal Education Partnerships ("STEP") 
Program. The STEP program authorizes eLlgible TEDs to 
participate in a pilot project that allows TEDs to operate 
federal education programs in schools located on Indian 
reservations. STEP grants were awarded to the Nez Perce 
Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, 
the Navajo Nation, and the Chickasaw Nation. AU of these 
tribes have been long time members ofTEDNA. 
NARF and TEDNA have been working with NCAI and 
NIEA on tlie Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
("ESEA") amendments to provide for greater tribal self­
determination in the area of education. Several bills were 
recently introduced -The Strengthening America's Schools 
Act, S. 1094, and the Student Success Act, H.R. 5, are the 
primary bills. The Senate bill, S. 1094, included some of Native American Right s Fund 
Indian Country's recommendations for ESEA reauthoriza­
tion, but unfortunately failed to include many important 
recommendations. H.R. 5 completely re-tools the ESEA 
and eliminates several Indian education prog rams. It is not 
likely that the House and Senate will come together to reau­
thorize the ESEA, but TEDNA, NCAI. NIEA, and NARF 
are continuing to work with Congress to incorporate Indian 
Country's recommendations into the ESEA reauthorization. 
If we are unable to get our provfaions in the reauthorization, 
or should the ESEA not pass, TEDNA. NCAI. and NIEA 
have been working on a stand-alone bill, the Native CLASS 
Act, to achieve greater tribal self-determination in educa­
tion. We will work with the Senate Committee on Indian 
Affairs to pass the Native CLASS Act as a whole or in piece­
meaJ fashion depending on the political climate. 
TED NA also worked on a Gates Foundation project with 
NCAI. TEDNA and NARF's portion of the project was to 
develop a Decision Making Guide that was intended to pro­
vide tribes and TEAs with an outline of select K-12 
federal programs in which TEAs can potentially participate 
and thereby provide options for TEAs to enhance their role 
in Native education. The Guide can be seen on TEDNA's 
website, or a copy can be obtained by contacting NARF. Civi.1 and Cultural Rights 
From the embryonic days of our Nation, Indian tribes 
have long struggled against the assimilationist policies insti­
tuted by the United States which sought to destroy tribal 
cultures by removing Native American children from their 
tribes and families. As an example, the federal government 
failed to protect Indian children from misguided and insen­
sitive chiJd welfare practices by state human service agencies, 
which resulted in the unwarranted removal of Indian chil­
dren from their families and tribes and placement of those 
children in non-Indian homes. Statistical and anecdotal 
information show that Indian children who grow up in non­
Indian settings become spiritual and cultural orphans. They 
do not entirely fit into the culture in which they are raised 
and yearn throughout their life for the family and tribal 
culture denied them as children. Many Native chiJdren 
raised in non-Native homes experience identity problems, 
drug addiction, alcoholism, incarceration and, most 
disturbing, suicide. 
In order to address these problems facing tribes as a result 
of the loss of their children, the Indian Child Welfare Act 
(ICWA) was enacted by Congress in 1978. It established 
minimum federal jurisdictional, procedural and substantive 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
st.andards aimed to achieve the dual purposes of protecting 
the right ofan Indian chjJd to live with an Indian family and 
to stabilize and foster continued tribal existence. Since that 
time, there have been misinterpretations and, in some cases, 
outright refusal to follow the intent of the law by state 
agencies and courts. 
State services frequently do not reach village Alaska. Tribal 
courts must therefore handle most cases involving the 
welfare of village children. State recognition of those tribal 
court proceedings is therefore critical to assure that proceed­
ings which occur in tribal court are then respected by other 
state agencies. Otherwise, adoptive parents may not be able 
to participate in state-funded assistance programs, to secure 
substitute birth certificates necessary to travel out of state, to 
enroll children in school, or to secure medical care. 
In March 2011, the Alaska Supreme Court published its 
decision ln State of Alaska v. Native Village of Tanana and 
reaff1rmed that (1) Alaska Tribes had not been divested of 
their jurisdiction to adjudicate children's custody cases, and 
(2) Alaska's tribes have concurrent jurisdiction with the 
State. The court further held that tribes tlhat had not reas­
sumed exclusive jurisdiction under the Indian Child Welfare 
Act nonetlheless had concurrent jurisdiction to initiate 
ICWA-defined child custody proceed ings, regardless of the 
presence of Indian country and that as such, the declsions of 
tribal courts in these cases were due full faith and credit 
under ICWA. 
Following the Alaska Supreme Court's decision upholding 
tribal authority to initiate children' s proceedings, NARF has 
been working with the Alaska State Attorney General's office 
to formaliiie policies and protocol to implement the Tanana 
decision. 
The ICWA establishes adoptive placement preferences 
for placing an Indian child with a member of the child's 
extended family, other members of the child's tribe, or with 
other Indian families. A court may deviate from these pref­
erences only upon a showing of good cause. NARF has 
worked with tribes on the issue of ensuring that state courts 
abide by a tribe's adoptive placement preference. In Alaska, 
courts had been applying the incorrect standard -the pre­
ponderance of the evidence standard -instead of the clear 
and convincing standard of proof. At issue in Native Village 
Annua l Report 2013 ofT ununak v. State of Alaska was this proper burden of proof 
that the Alaska Office of Children's. Services must meet in 
order to move a child from one placement to another. 
NARF authored an amicus brief in the case on behaff of the 
Native Village of Kotzebue. 
In June 2013 the Alaska Supreme Court issued an impor­
tant ruling in the case which held that ICWA implicitly 
mandates that good cause to deviate from ICWA's adoptive 
placement preferences be proved by clear and convincing 
evidence, not the weaker preponderance of the evidence 
standard. Trus is an important decision because Alaska had 
been the only state where courts applied the preponderance 
of the evidence burden of proof to findings of good cause to 
deviate from ICWA's adoption preferences. In addition, the 
court's opinion also includes important language on the 
need for trial courts to evaluate the suitability of placements 
not under "white, middle class standards" but under "the 
prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian com­
munity." Unfortunately, the ruling did not end the status of 
the appeal as the adopt ive parents have now asked the Court 
to revise its ruling in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's deci­
sion in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. The Alaska Court has 
asked the parties to brief the effect, if any of Baby Veronica 
on the pending adoption case. NARF submitted an arnicus 
brief in November 2013 in support of the tribal placement 
preference. Oral argument was heard and a dec:ision is 
expected later this year. 
In. Parks v. S immonds, after numerous hearings, the 
Minto Tribal Court terminated the parental rights of Mr. 
Parks and Ms. Stearman and granted permanent custody of 
a child to the Simmonds. Mr. Parks sued in state court, 
claiming, among other things, that the tribal court has no 
jurisdiction over him and that his right to due process was 
violated when the Minto Court -in accordance with its tra­
ditional practices and procedures -did not permit Mr. 
Parks' attorney to present oral argument. Based on these 
arguments, Mr. Parks claims that the tribal court termjna­
tion order is not entitled to full faith and credit under 
ICWA. The Simmonds argued that the termination order is 
entitled to full faith and credit and they moved to dismiss 
the state court action, but this motion was denied by the 
state court in November 2010. The state court reasoned 
that failure to allow an attorney to present oral argument 
did violate Mr. Parks' due process rights. Native American Right s Fund 
The Simmonds petitioned the Alaska Supreme Court for 
review. The petition was granted in March 2011 and the 
case was remanded to the trial court for it to make specific 
factual findings and legal conclusions. Briefing on remand 
was concluded in May 2011 and oral argument was held in 
December 2011. The trial court issued findings and con­
cluded in part that tribal courts may not have jurisdiction 
over nonmembers outside of Indian Country, and also sug­
gested that tribal courts must permit oral argument. The 
Simmonds filed another petition for review with the Alaska 
Supreme Court asking that numerous aspects of this deci­
sion be overturned. In July 2012, the Alaska Supreme 
Court granted the petition for review and the Simmonds' 
principal brief was filed in December 2012. It took over 
eight months for the Respondents briefs to be filed. The 
Simmonds' reply brief was filed in October 2013 and oral 
argument has been scheduled for early March 2014. 
In Toyukuk iv. Treadwell, NARF and national law firm 
Wilson Elser, acting on behalf of two tribal councils and two 
Alaska Native voters, filed suit in federal court in July 2013 
charging state elections officials with ongoing violations of 
the federal Voting Rights Act and the United States 
Constitution. The suit claims state officials have failed to provide oral language assistance to citizens whose first lan­
guage is Yup'ik, the primary language of many AJaska 
Natives in the Dillingham and Wade Hampton regions. 
In the complaint, Mr. Toyukuk of Manakotak, Mr. 
Augustine of Alakanuk, the Native Village of Hooper Bay, 
and the Traditional Village of Togiak asked the court to 
order state election officials to comply with the language 
assistance provisions of the Voting Rights Act and the voting 
guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to 
the United States Constitution. 
The relief they requested includes implementing proce­
dures in the Dillingham and Wade Hampton areas similar 
to those secured by Alaska Natives in the Bethel area in the 
Nick, et al. v. Bethel, et al. Litigation, requiring state election 
officials to obtain approval from the federal court or the 
Attorney General of the United States for any changes in 
those procedures, and to appoint federal observers to over­
see future elections in the two regions. "Language asslstance " 
requires translating ballots and other election materials and 
information into Yup'ik and provirung trained bilingual staff 
to register voters and to help voters at the polls through 
complete, accurate, and uniform translations. 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
Seven regions of Alaska, including the Dillingham and 
Wade Hampton regions, are required to provide language 
assistance for Alaska Natives under Section 203, the lan­
guage assistance provision of the Voting Rights Act. Section 
203 applies to states and localities that meet certain thresh­
old requirements for the numbers of citizens with Limited 
English proficiency. Two additional regions of Alaska have 
to provide language assistance in non-Native languages. 
The voting guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit state 
officials from denying the right to vote on account of race or 
color, which federal courts have found includes Native voters. 
Last year, the Supreme Court in the Shelby County case 
invalidated Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act which 
required preclearance by the Justice Department of changes 
in state voting laws in certain states with histories of dis­
crimination. On behalf of Bristol Bay Native Corpora tion, 
NARF is currently working on a Congres sional amendment 
to the Voting Rights Act that would replace Section 4 and 
protect Alaska Natives. 
International Recognition of Indigenous Peoples 
The development of international laws and standards to 
protect the rights of indigenous peoples greatly benefits 
Native American peoples. NARF and NCAI entered into 
an attorney-client relationship over a decade ago for the 
purpose of working in the international arena to protect 
indigenous rights. 
In September 2007, the United Nations General 
Assembly overwhelmingly adopted the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (U.N. DRIP). The vote was 
143 in favor, 4 opposed, and 11 abstaining. The votes in 
opposition were Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the 
United States. This historic vote came after 30 years of 
worldwide indigenous efforts. N ARF has represented the 
National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) in this mat­
ter since 1999. The U.N. DRIP recognizes that indigenous 
peoples have important collective human rights in a multi­
tude of areas, including self determination, spiritualit y, and 
lands, territories and natural resources. The U.N. DRIP sets 
out minimum standards for the treatment of indigenous 
peoples and can serve as the basis for the development of 
customary international law. 
Annua l Report 2013 In 2009 Australia and New Zealand reversed their posi­
tions and now support the U.N. DRIP. Canada endorsed 
the U.N. DRIP in November 2010 and in December 2010, 
President Obama made the historic announcement that the 
U.S. was reversing its negative vote and now endorses the 
U.N. DRIP 
In February and March, 2013, NARF. on behalf ofNCAI, 
participated in a meeting of the North American Indigenous 
People caucus to prepare for the High Level Plenary I World 
Conference on Indigenous People (WCIP) to be held in 
New York City in September 2014 and for the Indigenous 
preparatory meeting in Alta, Norway in June 2013. 
In May 2013. NARF. along with its client NCAI and 72 
tribes and other Non-governmental Organizations signed 
onto a statement read at the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues which highlighted those issues deemed 
most important to be dealt with at the WCIP: establishment 
of a body at the UN to monitor implementation of The 
Declaration within the UN and by States; creation of a per­
manent, dignified and appropriate status for Indigenous 
Peoples at the UN; and, address violence against women. 
In June 2013 NARF participated in the Indigenous 
preparatory meeting in Alta, Norway. This meeting pro­
duced an outcome document which will be used by indige­
nous peoples to lobby states in advance of the WCIP. 
NARF has also presented 2 webinars and made a presenta­
tion on the WCIP at NCAI's Annual meeting in Tulsa, OK 
in October 2013 to help educate tribal leaders about the 
WCIP and their need to participate. 
The adoption of the U.N. DRIP has impacted the 
Organization of American States (OAS) process. NARF 
also represents NCAI in this process. In November 2007 it 
was agreed that the U.N. DRIP would be used as the foun­
dation for an OAS document, in that all the terms of the 
OAS document would be consistent with, or more favorable 
to, Indigenous rights than the U.N. DRIP. It was further 
agreed that the terms of the OAS declaration would be 
agrel!d upon through a consensus based decision making 
process which includes Indigenous represent atives. The 
United States and Canada, who at the time opposed the 
U.N. DRIP, nevertheless agreed they would not oppose the 
process moving forward in the OAS. Native American Right s Fund 
The most recent OAS negotiation session was held in 
April 2012 in Washington, D.C. Disappointingly the U.S. 
and Canada did not actively participate even though they 
both now support the U.N. DRIP The session lasted only 
three days and progress was hampered by the lack of fund­
ing to enable the Indigenous caucus to meet ahead of time 
and work on its proposals. There was one highlight, how­
ever, with the approval of a treaty provision supporting the understanding of the indigenous peoples involved in any 
given treaty. No additional negotiation sessions were held in 
2013 and none have been set for 2014 as of this time. It is 
not clear that the polWcal will exists among the states of the 
OAS to make the Declaration a priority. 
NARF represents the Pottawatomi Nation of Canada, a 
band of descendants from the Historic Pottawatomi Nation, 
which from 1795 to 187 3 signed a series of treaties with the 
United States. These treaties provided for the payment of 
certain annuities. The ancestors of the present-day 
Canadian Pottawatomi fled to Canada following the signing 
of the final treaty and were never paid their annuities as 
promised . The American Pottawatomi bands recovered the 
payment of these annuities in the Indian Claims 
Commission (ICC), but the Pottawatomi members who 
now reside in Canada could not bring a claim in the ICC. 
In 1993, NARF brought suit on behalf of the Pottawatorni 
Nation in Canada in the Court of Federal Claims, by way of 
a congressional reference bill, to seek redress. The Nation 
and the U.S. Department of Justice reached a settlement in 
principle and the Court of Federal Claims accepted the 
settlement in September 2000, and recommended the 
settlement to Congress in January 2001. 
Attempts to pass congressional legislation approving the 
settlement agreement have stalled on several occasions in the 
107 th Congress through the 111 th Congress. In January 
2011, Senator Inouye introduced Senate Bill 60 for consid­
eration during the 112th Congress. Senate Bill 60 was 
referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary where 
NARF worked closely with Chairman Leahy's staff in coor­
dination with Senator lnouye's staff. NARF was successful 
in getting S.60 "hot-Lined" out of the Senate Judiciary 
Committ ee during the lame-duck session, but we were 
unable to secure unanimous consent or a vote on the bill 
before the end of the session. With Senator Inouye's untimely 
death during the lame-duck session of the 112th Congress, 
NARF and the leadership for the Pottawatomi Nation in 
Canada must now determine whether and how to move 
forward.

Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and fodjan nations is the inherent duty for 
all levels of government to recognize and responsibly enforce 
the many laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples 
and the trust duties to which those give rise. Because such 
laws impact virtually every aspect of tribal life, NARF main­
tains its involvement in the legal matters pertaining to 
accountability of governments to Native Americans. 
Annua l Report 2013 NARF represents forty-one tribes in an action in federal 
district court for the District of Columbia seeking full and 
complete accountings of their trust funds. Such accountings 
never have been provided by the federal government which 
is the trustee for the funds. In December 2011, active 
claims settlement negot:iatioos on a tribe by tribe basis begl!fl 
for many tribes. To date 31 of NARF's client tribes i.n this 
case have reached settlement agreements with the United 
States totaling over $400 milHon. These settlement agree-Native American Right s Fund 
ments have been approved by the federal district court. 
NARF continues to represent its remaining client tribes in 
this case in their on-going settlement negotiations. 
In April 2013, NARF filed suit on behalf of ten more 
tribes seeking full and complete accountings of their trust 
funds. In dfacussions with the Justice Department regard­
ing the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate v. Jewell tribal trust funds 
case, the government indicated that it was willing to enter 
into settlement negotiations with NARF's ten tribal clients 
involved in the case. 
The Tonkawa Tribe in OkJahoma has retained NARF to 
represent it in its pending action in the federal district court 
for the Western District of Oklahoma for histor:ical account­
ings of its trust funds and assets. NARF and experts retained 
by NARF have reviewed the Tribe's trust account data pro­
vided by the government in the context of political negoti­
ated settlements. The government and the Tribe have 
reached an agreement of settlement in this case and are 
proceeding to execute the agreement. 
NARF has been retained by the Muscogee Creek Nation 
in Oklahoma to represent the Nation in its on-going case 
against the federal government for accountings of its tribal 
trust accounts, funds, and assets. The case was filed in U.S. 
District Court for the District of Columbia in 2 006, and the 
parties have been engaged in settlement negotiations at the 
political level since 2012. NARF is in the process of review­
ing with the Nation the data that the Nation has received 
from the government in the context of settlement negotia­
tions and assessing the Nation's claims in the case. 
NARF represents the Turtle Mountain Chippewa, 
Chippewa Cree, White Earth Band of Minnesota 
Chippewa, and Little Shell Chippewa Tribes in this case 
against the federal government for misac counting and mis­
management of their tribal trust fund, the Pembina 
Judgment Fund (PJF), since the inception of the fund in 
1964. In 2006, the Tribes defeated the United States' 
motion to havie the case dismissed. Since August 2007, 
the parties have been trying to resolve the lribes' claims pri­
marily through alternative dispute resolution proceedings 
before a Settlement Judge of the Court of Federal Claims. 
In August 2009, the parties reached agreement at least for 
settlement negotiations purposes on the population of "baseline" (non-investment) transactions in the PJF. Since 
that time the parties have been negotiating the Pembinas' 
claims of the government's investment mismanagement of 
the PJF and discussi ng numerous procedural matters in the 
event that agreement is reached on a settlement amount. 
In Cobell v. Salazar, NARF and private co-counsel A.led 
this class action case in federal district court In Washington, 
D.C. in 1996 to force the federal government to provide an 
accounting to approximately 300,000 individual Indian 
money account holders who have their funds held in trust 
by the federal government. Through years of litigation, 
decisions of the federal district court and the federal court of 
appeals held that the government was in breach of trust and 
must provide an accounting. NARF was active in the case 
until 2006 when the case was fully staffed and NARF's 
resources were shifted over to help 41 unrepresented Tribes 
who faced a deadline to file suit against the federal govern­
ment for accountings of their tribal funds held in trust by 
the federal government under the same system. That tribal 
trust fund litigation is proceed ing. 
In December 2010, President Obama signed into law a 
Cobell settlement of $1.5 billion to be paid to the 300,000 
indiv.idual Indian money account holders with another $1.9 
billion made available to pay individual Indians who want 
to sell their small fractionated interests in their trust lands to 
the federal government to be turned over to their Tribes. 
The federal district court approved the settlement in June 
2011, and the decision was appealed. The federal district 
court also awarded $99 mmion in attorneys' fees and 
expenses .in June 2011. NARF. through its pro bono attor­
neys, submitted an applkation for attorneys' fees and 
expenses for its work on the case. The Court of Appeals 
heard oral arguments in the first appeal of the decision to 
approve the settlement in February 2012. The Court of 
Appeals affirmed the federal district court's approval of the 
settlement in May 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court denied 
review of the case and NARF is now waiting for the federal 
district court to make a decision on our application for 
attorneys' fees and expenses. The federal district court held 
a hearing on the matter in March 2013 and referred it to a 
magistrate judge for mediation in hopes of resolving the 
matter before issuing a ruling. Mediation was held in April 
2013 and was unsuccessful. The matter is back to the 
federal district court for decision.

Annua l Report 2013 Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
The coordinated development of Indian Jaw and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws and issues is essential for 
the continued protection of Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian 
law practitioners and other Indian organizations. NARF has 
three ongoing projects which are aimed at achieving this 
goal: the Indigenous Peacemaking Initiative; the National 
Indian Law Library; and the Indian Law Support Center. 
Indigenous Peacem aking Initiative 
The mission of NARF's Indigenous Peacemaking 
Initiative GPI) project is to promote and support Native 
peoples in restoring sustainable peacemaking practices. This 
project provides NARF with an opportunity to support 
traditional peacemaking and community building practices 
as an extension of Indian law and sovereign rights. The 
project is guided by an Advisory Committee consisting of 
traditional peacemaking experts and practitioners, including 
a NARF Board member. 
Peacemaking is a communit y-directed process to develop 
consensus on a conflict resolution plan that addresses the 
concerns of all interested parties. The peacemaking process 
uses traditional rituals such as the group circle, and 
Clan structures, to involve the parties to a conflict, their 
supporters, elders and interested community members. 
Within the circle, people can speak from the heart in a 
shared search for understanding of the conflict, and together 
identify the steps necessary to assist in healing all affected 
parties and to prevent future occurrences and conflicts. 
NARF and the Advisory Committee will accomplish the 
IPI mission by: promoting traditional peacemaking 
practices; raising awareness about peacemaking practices; 
spotlighting existing programs that have had success with 
model programs; coordinating a Traditional Peacemaking 
Practices Clearinghouse; creating a peacemak ing clearing­
house by cataloging codes, manuals, curricula and best prac­
tices; digitizing all records for easy dissemination; creating 
an anthology olf successful programs and individuals within 
peacemaking; convening traditional peacemaking meetings; 
coordinating meetings for a variety of audiences interested 
in peacemaking (tribal leaders, tribal peacemakers, tribal 
judges, policymakers, non-native peacemakers) ; creating training and teaching opportunities; documenting and 
disseminating best practices; development of curriculum, 
case studies, and tools; providing training on various com­
ponents and techniques of peacemaking; mentoring and 
nurturing; and, supporting relationships and mentoring 
between and among individual peacemakers, programs, and 
communities. 
NARF and IPI Advisory Committee members continue 
to participate in planning for a national peacemaking gath­
ering, to be held in March or April, 2014 at the Chickasaw 
Nation, and co-sponsored by the Chickasaw Nation and the 
Tribal Judicial Institute at the University of North Dakota. 
The national peacemaking gathering will offer the project 
a chance to report back to Tribal representatives the results 
of a survey administered in 2011 to tribal justice system 
employees. The gathering wiU also be an opportunity to roll 
out a higher visibility for the project, and preparations are 
underway to have avaHable information on resources 
compiled for the project. 
The National Indian Law Library (NILL) staff have devel­
oped a draft web page and continue integrating that page 
with the electronic versions of resources on Peacemaking in 
the NILL catalog. The webpage will serve as a basis for out­
reach and provide easy access to resources gathered for the 
project. The project also continues to grow and strengthen 
its networks, as part of raising awareness and also recruiting 
additional expert resources. The project has also been work­
ing closely with Columbia Law School to complement each 
other's work, and the Colorado University Indian Law 
Clinic has recently placed an intern to help in development 
and analysis of the catalog of resources for the project. 
The National Indian Law Library 
The National Indian Law Library (NILL) is the only law 
library in the United States devoted to Indian Law. The 
Library serves both NARF and members of the public. Since 
it was started as a NARF project in 1972, NILL has collected 
nearly 9,000 resource materials that relate to federal Indian 
and tribal law. The Library's holdings include the largest 
collection of tribal codes, ordinances and constitutions; legal 
pleadings from major Indian cases; and often hard to find 
reports and historical legal information. In addition to 
making its catalog and extensive collection available to the 
Annual Report 2013 Native American Rights Fund 
public, NILL provides reference and research assistance 
relating to Indian law and tribal law and its profe$ional 
staff answers over 2,000 questions each year. In addition, 
the Library has created and maintains a huge web site that 
provides access to thousands of full-text sources to help the 
researcher. See www.narf/org/nill/ index.htm. 
With more than 400 participating tribes, NARF's 
National Indian Law Library Comprehensive Tribal Law 
Index collection of tribal laws continues to grow. Web use 
statistics show that the online tribal law collection is seeing 
more visitors, with about 8,000 page visits per month. To 
accommodate this growth and increase usability, NILL has 
developed an improved architecture for the online tribal law 
collection. The new tribal law gateway was released in 
August 2012 and as of December 2013, more than 300 
individual tribe's pages have been launched!. We plan to roll 
out all of the remaining tribal pages over the next several 
months. Each tribe wiU have a web page outUning exactly 
what tribal law materials -from codes and constitutions to 
tribal cow1: opinions -are available and where they can be 
found. 
NILL is also organizing several free webinars on Indian 
law research. The purpose of these webinars is to provide 
practical guidance on how to research tribal law -a difficult 
and misunderstood area of law. NILL plans on providing at 
least three free sessions avajlable to members of the Oregon 
bar, American Association of Law Libraries, and tribal 
members and tribal governments. The purpose of these ses­
sions is to !help the public understand how to utiljze the free 
NILL research tools and services as well as understand 
which fee-based services also provide quaUty content. tribal 
law is a gPowing area of law as tribal governments exercise 
their inherent jurisdiction and develop their law in a way 
that meets and honors their traditional and customary ways 
of Ufe. 
NILL also recently developed email sign-up and donation 
apps for our Facebook pages, which will allow our Facebook 
fans to more easily become involved in NARF e-actions and 
provide NARF with financial support. A soft introduction 
of the PeacemakJng website to selected colleagues within the 
field has been implemented and is now working with peace­
makers nation-wide to develop materials for this new online 
resource. NARF's final web statistics for 2013 showed 25% 
Annua l Report 2013 growth year-over-year with 767, 732 page views and 
314,625 unique visitors to our website. 
Indian Law Support Center 
NARF continues Ito perform Indian Law Support Center 
duties by sending regular electronic mailouts nationwide to 
the 25 Indian Legal Services (ILS) programs, hosting a 
national listserv, handUng requests for assistance, and work­
ing with llS programs to secure a more stable funding base 
from Congress. The Indian Tribal Justice and Legal 
Assistance Act of 2000 authorizes the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DO] to provide supplemental fundjng to Indian 
legal services programs for their representation of Indian 
people and Tribes which fall below federal poverty guide­
lines. After funding in 2003, 2004, and 2005, funding in 
2006 -2009 was unsuccessful. In 2010, NARF secured a 
Une item appropriation of $2.35 mil lion from Congress. In 
FY 2011, Congress appropriated $2.49 million for civil and 
criminal assistance in tribal courts. In FY 2012, both civil 
and criminal grants were awarded to NARF in the amounts 
of $850,659 and $875,000 respectively, and most recently, 
NARF was awarded civil and criminal grants in the 
amounts of $715,000 and $515,000, respectively from the 
FY 2013 federal budget. Funding amounts were reduced 
due to the effects of budget cuts and sequest ration. NARF 
distributes these funds to the ILS programs. 
Other Activities 
In addition to its major projects, NARF continued its 
participation in numerous conferences and meetings of 
Indian and non-Indian organizations in order to share its 
knowledge and expertise in Indian law. During the past 
fiscal year, NARF attorneys and staff served in formal or 
informal speakJng and leadership capacities at numerous 
Indian and Indian-related conferences and meetings such as 
the National Congress of American Indians Executive 
Council, Midyear and Annual Conventions and the Federal 
Bar Association's Indian Law Conference. NARF rremains 
firmly committed to continuing its effort to share the legal 
expertise which it possesses with these groups and individuals 
working in support oflndian rights and to foster the recog­
nition of Indian rights in mainstream society. Native Ameri can Right s Fund 
Based on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2013, the Native American Rights Fund reports 
unrestricted revenues of $11.692,615 against total expenditures of 
$9,372,448. Total revenue and net assets at the end of the year came 
to $12,478,718 and $19,087,742, respectively. Due to presentation 
requlrements of the audited financial :statements In terms of recogntzlng 
the tlm1ng of certain revenues and expenses, they do not reflect the fact 
that, based on NARF:S Internal reportllng, revenue exceeded expenses and 
other cash outlays resulting In an Increase of $2,268,828 to NARF:S 
reserve fund. When compared to fiscal year 2012: The Increase In Public 
Contributions Is mostly due to receiving approximately $800,000 more 
Ln bequests (this area can vary Widely from one year to the next). The 
decrease in 1i'Lbal Contributions Is due to the difference In contributions 
from our Nez Perce v. Salazar clients (who received settlement awards from the federal government in fiscal year 2012). Federal Awards relate 
to our Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) contracts (the majority of which 
Is also Included In expenses since It Ls paid-out to sub-recipients), we con­
tinue to be awarded new contracts. We received new foundation grants 
that were restricted to our work In Alaska. Legal fees held steady. The 
Gain on Disposal of Property In fiscal year 2012 relates to the sale of our 
Washington, D.C. building. We had no sales of property and equipment 
In fiscal year 2013. Along with the overall investment markets, NARF:S 
Investments continue to have very favorable performances.

Native Ways Federation -The Native Ways Federation 
{Native Ways) is the only workplace giving program in the 
United States to exclusively fund Native nonprofits that 
serve people and communities in Indian Counttry. To learn 
more about Native Ways and the participating nonprofits, 
or to see how your company can support Indian Country 
through workplace giving, please visit www.nativeways

Federated Workplace Campai gns -Thank you to the 
hundreds of federal, state, municipal and private sector 
employees throughout the country who through their pay­
roll deduction plans contributed to NARF in fiscal year 
2013. 
Show Your Support in NARF's programs -NARF receives 
contributions from many sources and for many purposes. 
Below are descriptions ofNARF's donor programs and addi­
tional ways you can get involved. 
Peta Uha Membership -Peta Uha in the Lakota (Sioux) 
language means ftrekeeper. One that honors tribal members 
who made a solemn commitment to ensure that the sacred 
flame, source of Light, heat and energy for his people, would 
always be kept burning. Like the ftrekeepers of old, 
members of the Peta Uha Council can demonstrate constancy 
and vigilance by helping to ensure that the critical work of 
the Native American Rights Fund continues to move ever 
forward . For benefits associated with each level of Peta Uha 
membership, please contact our Development Department, 
303.44 7 .8760. 
Tsamihwit Circle -Tsanahwit is a Nez Perce word meaning 
equal justice. Tsaruihwit Circle members provide a regular 
source of income to NARF by pledging and making monthly 
contributions. Smaller monthly contributions add up over 
the year to make a real difference. 
Otu'han Gift Membership -Otu'han is the Lakota Sioux 
word translated as giveaway. Otu'han is a memoriaJ and 
honoring gift program modeled after the tradition of the 
Indian giveaway in which items of value are gathered over a long period of time to be given away in honor of birthdays, 
marriages, anniversaries, and in memory of a departed 
loved one. 
Circle of Life -NARF's Circle of Life are donors who 
provide a lasting legacy to the Native American Rights Fund 
by including NARF in estate planning or deferred gifts. 
The circle is an important symbol to Native Americans, 
representing unity, strength and the eternal continuity of 
life. These lasting gifts help ensure the future ofNARF and 
our Indian clients nationwide. 
Endowments -NARF has two established endowments. 
The 21st Century Endowment is a permanent fund in 
which the principal is invested and interest income is used 
for NARF's programs. This endowment is designed to 
provide a permanent, steady income that can support the 
ever-increasing costs of providing legaJ representation to our 
tribaJ clients. The Living Waters Endowment directly funds 
the 21st Century Endowment. It aJlows donors to honor 
friends and loved ones by making an endowment gift of 
$10,000 or more. By designating a gift to either endow­
ment, you can be sure that your contribution will continue 
to generate annuaJ funds in perpetuity. 
Workplace Campaigns -NARF is a member of America's 
Charities, a national workplace giving federation. Giving 
through your workplace is as easy as checking off NARF's 
box, #10350 on the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) 
pledge form authorizing automatic payrolJ deduction. 
Matching Gifts -Currently, 16 foundations and 
corporations nationwide make matching gifts to NARF on 
a regular basis. Employers match their employees' contribu­
tions sometimes doubling or even tripling their donation. 
Please check with your human resources office and request 
a matching gift form. 
E-Action -Sign up for our e-action network by providing 
NARF with your email address . This is a great way to get 
periodic case updates, calls-to-action, special events infor­
mation, invitations and other activities. Your e-mail address 
is confidentiaJ and we will not share it with any outside 
sources. For further information about any of the programs or 
services, please contact NARF's Development Department 
at 303-447-8760. Thank you.

Statement on Environmental Sustainabili ty." 
"It is clear that our natural world is undergoing severe, unsustainable 
and catastrophic climate change that adversely impacts the lives of people 
and ecosystems worldwide. Native Americans are especially vulnerable 
and are experiencing disproportionate negative impacts on their cultures, 
health and food systems. In response, the Native American Rights Fund 
(NARF) is committed to environmental sustainability through its mission, 
work and organizational values. Native Americans and other indigenous 
peoples have a long tradition of living sustainably with the natural world 
by understanding the importan ce of preserving natural resources and 
respecting the interdependence of all living things. NARF embraces this 
tradition through its work and by instituting sustainable office practices 
that reduce our negative impact on our climate and environment. 
NARF is engaged in environmental work and has established a Green 
Office Committee whose responsibility is to lead and coordinate staff 
participation in establishing and implementing policies and procedures 
to minimize waste, reduce energy consumption and pollution and create 
a healthful work environm ent." 1506 koa4wa1 , Dov.14er, CO 80302
