Fifteen years later they still work towards federal legislation to ratify the agreement.Status: ActiveAfter almost 30 years of advocacy, the Tule River Indian Tribe, represented by NARF, successfully settled its water rights in November 2007 by signing a Settlement Agreement with water users on the South Fork Tule River of California. The Settlement Agreement secures a domestic, municipal, industrial, and commercial water supply for the Tribe.The Tribe now seeks federal legislation to ratify the Settlement Agreement and authorize appropriations to develop the water rights through the creation of water infrastructure and reservoirs on the Tule Reservation. Year after year, bills introduced in the House and Senate have not passed. We continue to work towards the possible introduction and passage of a water settlement bill.  Additionally, we are continuing work with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on necessary studies for the feasibility and design of the Tribe’s water storage project.More CasesShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
