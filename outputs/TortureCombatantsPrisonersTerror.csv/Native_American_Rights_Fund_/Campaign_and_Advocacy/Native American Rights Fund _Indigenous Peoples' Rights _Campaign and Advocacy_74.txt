Shirley (Tribes lack authority to tax non-Indian businesseswithin their reservations) and Nevada v.Hicks (Tribal Courts lack jurisdiction to hear cases brought by tribalmembers against non-Indians for harm done on trust lands within theirreservations). These opinions weredevastating in that they struck crippling blows to tribal sovereignty and tribaljurisdiction -- the most fundamental elements of continued tribal existence. These losses were indicative of the Court's steadydeparture from the longstanding, established principles of Indian law and wereamong a string of losses suffered by Indian tribes over the past two decades.In response, in September 2001, Tribal Leaders met in Washington, D.C., and established the Tribal Supreme Court Project (Project) as part of the Tribal Sovereignty ProtectionInitiative.The purpose of the Project is to strengthen tribal advocacy before the U.S. Supreme Court by developingnew litigation strategies and coordinating tribal legal resources, and toultimately improve the win-loss record of Indian tribes. The Project is staffed by attorneys with theNative American Rights Fund (NARF) and the National Congress of AmericanIndians (NCAI) and consists of a Working Group of over 200 attorneys andacademics from around the nation who specialize in Indian law and other areasof law that impact Indian cases, including property law, trust law and SupremeCourt practice. In addition, an AdvisoryBoard of Tribal Leaders assists the Project by providing the necessarypolitical and tribal perspective to the legal and academic expertise.What Does the Tribal Supreme Court Project Do?The U.S. Supreme Court is ahighly specialized institution with a unique set of procedures that includescomplete discretion on whether it will hear a case, and a much keener focus onpolicy consideration than the lower federal courts.
