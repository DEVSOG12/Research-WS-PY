Nevertheless, serious human rights violations continue and efforts to implement a United Nations-facilitated transition blueprint have at times met with violent resistance from supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and other armed elements.Human Rights Watch welcomes the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation in Yemen. We share the view that the delay in creating a functioning independent and impartial investigation mechanism “may hamper the credibility of investigations and raises questions as to the commitment to redress and justice for victims of past human rights violations.” President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's government has not taken significant steps to address accountability for past human rights violations, contributing to the continued instability. President Hadi should without further delay nominate the commissioners to the independent commission of inquiry he established a year ago to look into the human rights violations associated with the 2011 popular uprising.  We also urge Yemen’s parliament to pass a transitional justice law that meets international standards because prosecutions of those responsible for unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture and other serious crimes will be a vital component of a meaningful transitional justice process.Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned by the government’s consistent failure to investigate attacks on journalists by security forces as well as other perpetrators. We urge the government to take a strong stand against such attacks and ensure judicial accountability for all perpetrators.The practice of child marriage in Yemen is widespread. Yemeni government and UN data show that over 50percent of girls in Yemen are married before the age of 18. We urge the parliament to resurrect legislation putting in place a minimum age of 18 for marriage for all.Since President Hadi assumed office, the United States has carried out some two dozen airstrikes against alleged members of opposition armed groups in Yemen, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which are estimated to have killed between 72 and 139 people, a large number of whom were civilians.Human Rights Watch calls on the Human Rights Council to renew its engagement with the government of Yemen and welcomes the draft resolution that focuses on efforts for accountability for past abuses, protection of journalists, and protection of women’s and girls’ rights.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa BahrainTopicChildren's Rights Torture United Nations Women's Rights Human Rights Council Free SpeechMore ReadingOctober 18, 2022DispatchesUN Rights Body Fails Yemeni People, AgainOctober 17, 2022StatementUN Human Rights Council must hold a special session on IranReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 8, 2022Report“It Was Really Hard to Protect Myself”Impact of the Armed Conflict in Syria on Children with DisabilitiesMore ReadingOctober 18, 2022DispatchesUN Rights Body Fails Yemeni People, AgainOctober 17, 2022StatementUN Human Rights Council must hold a special session on IranMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
