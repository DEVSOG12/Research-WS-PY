In this report, Asia Watch and the Tibet Information Network present the cases of some 275 prisoners with all extant biographical material. The lists clearly show that the majority of people arrested for nonviolent political activity in Tibet since 1987 have been young monks and nuns, and they provide important insights into the complexity of the prison system in Tibet. The lists also contain more information than has hitherto been available on women prisoners.Region / CountryChina and TibetProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet Updates On Rights Issues From Around The GlobeSign UpConnect With UsTwitterFacebookYouTubeInstagramFooter menuContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsBlackbaud Security IncidentSite MapChild Safeguarding© 2022 Human Rights WatchHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700Human Rights Watchis a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808Human Rights Watch
