SummaryIf it was the morning I was beaten by two men, if itwas the evening I was beaten by the guard on duty. They hit me with a piece ofwood, one used the butt of a gun and one kicked me. I was beaten for three daysand three nights...and we were shocked with electric current.Sopyani, sixteen-year old torture victim[1]"Arbitrary detention, abuse and torture, these appearto be standard operating procedure [in Aceh]."Foreign embassy official, Jakarta[2]Sopyani is currently serving a three-year sentence fortreason in a prison in Central Java.He was convicted after a trial in which hehad no legal representation and no opportunity to present a defense, and inwhich the prosecution presented no evidence against him apart from hisconfession, extracted under the conditions described above.While in pre-trial detention he was seriouslyand regularly beaten by police and military officials. He has not seen his family since he wastransferred to a prison more than 1,100 miles from his home in the northwest province of Aceh. He did not appeal his conviction because hefeared his sentence would be increased to penalize him for appealing. Sopyani is sixteen years old.His age may be unusual.His story is not.The Indonesian government has been fighting an on-again,off-again war with the armed separatist "Free Aceh Movement" (Gerakan AcehMerdeka, or GAM) for more than two decades.After a brief ceasefire and sporadic peace negotiations in late 2002 andearly 2003, on May 19, 2003, President Megawati Sukarnoputri imposed martiallaw and a state of military emergency in Aceh.An estimated 40,000 military and police were then deployed to Aceh tofight an estimated 5,000 armed members of GAM.Indonesiahas thrown a curtain over its military operations, closing most of Aceh toindependent observers since May 19, 2003.The situation has not materially changed since the status of Aceh was formallychanged to a civil emergency in May 2004. The military campaign, Indonesia's largest military undertaking sincethe invasion of East Timor in 1975,continues.When it resumed military operations in May 2003, Indonesiaannounced that this time it would pursue an "integrated operation" (operasi terpadu).Instead of only pursuing military victoryover GAM, this time the Indonesian government would also make efforts to winthe "hearts and minds" of the Acehnese people.Humanitarian operations (to mitigate the damage caused by a return towar) and good governance (to win the loyalty of the Acehnese)two of the"hearts and minds" provisions publicly highlighted when the operation wasinitially announced-have not commanded the sustained attention of seniorofficials or sufficient resources.Largely unnoticed by the few diplomats, journalists, andothers who follow the bloody armed conflict in Aceh is the "law enforcement" (penegakan hukum) prong of the integratedoperation.Since May 2003, the governmenthas arrested an estimated 2,000 alleged members or supporters of GAM.While membership in GAM is not a crime underIndonesian law, hundreds have been tried and convicted in Aceh, primarily oncriminal charges of "makar," whichtranslates into English as "treason" or "rebellion."Interviews by Human Rights Watch with thirty-five adult andchild prisoners from Aceh in five separate prisons in Central Java make itclear that to gain these convictionsand at other times just to punish allegedGAM members and sympathizersthe Indonesian military and police have oftenrelied on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment to coercedetainees into making signed or oral confessions of criminal conduct.[3]Interviewees told Human Rights Watch ofroutine beatings and threats of beatings, cigarette burnings, and the use ofelectro-shock. Several prisoners showed Human Rights Watch scars from tortureat the hands of Indonesian security forces.Forced confessions signed under such conditions have laterserved as the basis for convictions in trials that fail to follow Indonesianlaw or meet international standards of fairness and due process.In most cases arrests were made withoutnecessary arrest warrants, defense counsels took no part in preparing a defenseor participating in the trial, and no evidence or witnesses beyond dubiousconfessions were produced in court, making cross-examination of witnesses ortesting of evidence impossible.Thecrime of makar is so broad andill-defined as to make a legal defense extremely difficult.No less than in regular criminal cases in Indonesia,judicial corruption was rampant. Acehneseprisoners said that decisions appear to have been made in advance of courtproceedings, reflecting political or financial motivations of judges andprosecutors instead of reliance on evidence and the criminal code.Human Rights Watch interviewed several convicts who freelyadmitted they were either members of GAM or had financially or materiallysupported the separatists.In some casesthey claimed that they had offered such support under duress or simply to avoidbeing accused of being unsympathetic by men with the power of life and deathover them.The vast majority of convictsinterviewed vehemently denied that they had any association with GAM.However, this report does not attempt toprove the guilt or innocence of these prisoners.It is important to note that even if an accused was in factguilty of a criminal law violation, the use of torture and other forms of mistreatment,as well as major defects in the trial process, undermines the validity of anyconvictions obtained against that individual.Only if fair trials are conducted in an atmosphere free of mistreatmentand coercion can the results of those trials be given any credence.The scale of torture and the failure of due processdocumented in this report makes it clear that these are systemic failures, notjust the acts of rogue soldiers and police or untrained, poorly resourcedjudges and prosecutors.The stories oftorture are chilling and sadly similar to accounts of abuses committed byIndonesian security forces in Aceh in the past and in other parts of thecountry.They are also ironic, given Indonesia'srecent condemnation of U.S.abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.Major Farid Ma'ruf, a spokesman for Kopassus,the Indonesian military's notorious special forces unit, said, "It is ironicthat torture and sexual abuse were committed by the military of a country thatalways claims to be the world's human rights guardian.The treatment of Iraqi prisoners was clearlyinhumane because the military should have strict standards on how to properlyinterrogate detainees."[4]Kopassus forces are identified in this reportby a number of interviewees as responsible for torture and othermistreatment.In response to the annual U.S. State Department report onhuman rights, which highlighted a variety of abuses in Indonesia, in May 2004Marty Natalegawa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, shot back: "TheU.S. government does not have the moral authority to assess or act as a judgeof other countries, including Indonesia, on human rights, especially after theabuse scandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib Prison."[5]Yet Indonesiano less than the UnitedStates is obliged to respect the humanrights of all people on its soil.Whilerightly criticizing the UnitedStates for abuses at Abu Ghraib, theIndonesian government has signally failed to respond in a serious manner toallegations by Indonesian human rights lawyers, Human Rights Watch, and othersof grave and apparently systematic human rights violations in Aceh since theresumption of war in May 2003.Human Rights Watch urges the Indonesian government, andparticularly the Indonesian militarywhich is the most powerful institution inthe countryto take all necessary measures to immediately end the torture andmistreatment of detainees, whether for the purpose of extracting a confession,to exact retribution for real or alleged support of GAM, or for any otherreason.No statements made as a resultof torture or other coercion should be admitted into legal proceedings.To deter these practices, courts must applythe legal requirement under Indonesian law that two forms of evidence, notmerely a single confession, are required for a conviction. Indonesian judges and prosecutors must fulfilltheir role as judicial officers and refuse to accept legally insufficientevidence.The government should conductinvestigations into allegations of torture and other mistreatment.Criminal charges should be filed in cases inwhich credible evidence is discovered.Military and police officials should launch their own investigations anddiscipline personnel found to have committed, allowed, or been complicit in ornegligent in allowing such acts to take place.Human Rights Watch urges that in conformity with Indonesianand international law, all arrests except those in flagrante delicto ("in the act") should be carried out with awarrant.At the time of arrest detaineesshould be informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention and the chargesagainst them.Detainees must bepermitted adequate access to lawyers, family members, and proper medical care.Given the seriousness of the findings of this report, theNational Commission on Human Rights, Komnas HAM, should launch an investigationof detainee treatment and the trial process for those convicted of makar as the result of alleged or realassociation with GAM.The Indonesiangovernment should offer its full cooperation to Komnas HAM. Indonesia should invite the UnitedNations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatmentor Punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges andLawyers to investigate and report on these allegations and make relevantrecommendations.Without delay, itshould also implement the recommendations made by the United Nations Committeeagainst Torture in November 2001 to address Indonesia's dismal record oftorture and mistreatment.Because of prohibitions on access to Aceh, Human RightsWatch fears that the information on abuses contained in this report mayrepresent just the tip of a dangerous iceberg. It is crucial that the internationalcommunity, in particular the quartet (the U.S., E.U., Japan, and the WorldBank) that has attempted to broker a peace deal, insist in public and privatethat Indonesia open Aceh to independent national and international journalists,human rights workers, diplomats, and observers.Many of the abuses documented in this report may have been committedbecause soldiers and police have been able to operate behind closed doors andaway from public scrutiny.Greateropenness is necessary as a deterrent to further abuse.If Indonesiawants to win the "hearts and minds" of the Acehnese people, it is in Indonesia'sinterests to ensure that acts of torture and mistreatment are ended and unfairtrials and flawed convictions are stopped.Otherwise, Indonesia'slaw enforcement operation in Aceh will beand will be seen to beafailure.This will only increasemistrust and resentment within the Acehnese civilian population and willundermine the Indonesian government's efforts to convince the internationalcommunity of its commitment to human rights and reform in the country.There has been a significant expansion of freedoms inIndonesia since the fall of President Soeharto in 1998 and, with increasedpublic attention to the role of military brutality and abuse in exacerbatingIndonesia's internal conflicts, the prestige of the military for a timesuffered a major blow, which seemed to create a space for much-needed reformfor the first time in decades. Morerecently, however, the momentum for reform (reformasiis the Indonesian term) has almost ground to a halt, leaving many observersand friends of Indonesia concerned that the possibility of creating a statebased on the rule of law and respect for human rights, with a military undergenuine civilian control, is increasingly remote.After the recent debacle of the trials ofIndonesians for the 1999 atrocities in East Timor, where all of the Indonesiandefendants were either acquitted at trial or had their convictions overturnedon appeal, Indonesiahas little international capital on the issue of abuses by its military.The time for action and reform is now.II. MethodologyThis report consists almost entirely of first-hand testimonycovering many districts in Aceh.In thefirst quarter of 2004, Human Rights Watch traveled to Indonesia and interviewed thirty-five prisoners(including two children) from Aceh in five separate prisons in Central Java.In Indonesia, the UnitedStates, and the United Kingdom, Human Rights Watchalso interviewed over forty representatives of various embassies andgovernments, United Nations officials, representatives of national andinternational non-governmental organizations, media representatives, anddefense lawyers.During the course ofthe research, Human Rights Watch also engaged in written correspondence withIndonesian government officials.Human Rights Watch and other independent international humanrights organizations are still barred from entering Aceh.Without direct access to the province theability to verify and confirm information is hampered.Due to the risk of reprisal, we have changed or omitted thenames of Acehnese sources and the names of the prisons visited in Central Java.A Note on GAM AbusesSince the renewal of fighting in May 2003, GAM forces haveengaged in kidnapping, hostage taking, and the arbitrary detention of civiliansin violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.The most widely reported abduction by GAM forces involved areporter and cameraman for the Indonesian television station, RCTI.On June 29, 2003, two RCTI employees wereamong a group of civilians kidnapped by GAM in Langsa, EastAceh.The reporter, ErsaSiregar, cameraman Fery Santoro, their driver Rahmatsyah, and two civilians whowere accompanying them went missing while driving back to Lhokseumawe.On July 3, Teungku Mansoor, GAM spokesman forEast Aceh, announced that the crew was beingheld by GAM soldiers. He told an AFPreporter that "the reason that we are holding them for questioning is that theIndonesian military have been using the press to conduct intelligenceoperations in Aceh."[6]Rahmatsyah managed to escape on December 17, 2003. On December 29, 2003, Ersa Siregar, still inGAM captivity, was shot and killed in a firefight between GAM and TNIsoldiers.Fery Santoro was not releasedby GAM until May 16, 2004, almost a year after he was first taken hostage. His release, along with an estimated 150others, was eventually negotiated by the International Committee of the RedCross (ICRC) and the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI).The Indonesian military immediatelyquestioned whether or not GAM was continuing to hold other civilians againsttheir will.[7]It is unclear whether or not GAM is stillholding civilians.Human Rights Watch is concerned about possible abusescommitted by GAM, which like the Indonesian military has a long record ofabusive behavior in Aceh.But because Indonesiaprohibits Human Rights Watch from entering Aceh, we were unable to interviewpeople in, or released from, GAM custody.Human Rights Watch is acutely aware that a lack of testimony does notnecessarily mean a lack of abuses.Butuntil Indonesiaopens Aceh to independent observers, information on possible abuses by GAM willbe difficult to obtain.Human Rights Watch urges GAM to act in accordance with itsobligations under international humanitarian law.GAM may not, for instance, conduct attacksagainst civilians (including civilian officials), mistreat civilians orcombatants under its control, or hold persons as hostages.GAM also should not take actions that placecivilians at risk, such as confiscating identity cards for use by GAMcombatants.III. Background"Aceh is the most serious human rights crisis in Southeast Asia today."Matthew Daley, U.S. official[8]In a series of reports, Human Rights Watch has documentedwidespread human rights violations in Aceh since the start of militaryoperations in the province in May 2003.[9]Based on testimony from Acehnese refugees in Malaysia,there is substantial evidence that Indonesian security forces have engaged inextra-judicial executions, forced disappearances, beatings, arbitrary arrestsand detentions, and drastic limits on freedom of movement in Aceh. There is also a clear pattern of singling outand persecuting young men who the military claims, often with little or noevidence, are members or supporters of GAM.Indonesian security forces have often failed to distinguish between GAMcombatants and civilians.The past fifteen months of fighting have also caused massiveinternal displacement. Tens of thousandsof civilians have fled their homes and been forcibly relocated by the militaryfor operational reasons. The cumulativestrain of long-term conflict on the civilian population has been significant,with serious effects on the mental health of the population.[10]In May 2004, Komnas HAM reported that in the first sixmonths of martial law there had been an increase in the number of civilianvictims of violence, including arbitrary arrests, torture, kidnapping, sexualabuse, and extrajudicial killings. Itreported that both Indonesian security forces and GAM were responsible forserious human rights abuses in the province.[11]The fighting between GAM and the TNI is increasingly takingplace outside of Aceh's main towns, making it even more difficult to know whatis happening or who is being killed, wounded, or detained. Statistics on fatalities continue to bereported by wire services, quoting military statements from the province.In almost all accounts fatalities arerecorded as GAM or "rebel" deaths.Theseaccounts do not specify the circumstances of the deaths. Furthermore, thereported statistics on numbers killed in the province are inconsistent witheach other, raising more concerns about the credibility of the information andthe lack of comprehensive documentation of those killed in Aceh (see boxbelow).On May 19, 2004, one year after martial law was imposed inAceh, the military emergency was downgraded to a civil emergency.Formally, this meant a handover to a civilianadministrator for the province and the shifting of law enforcementresponsibilities from the military to the police.Major General Endang Surwarya, the martiallaw administrator, was now supposed to defer to the civilian rule of Aceh'sGovernor, Abdullah Puteh.In practice, it appears that very little has changed.Although Governor Puteh officially tookcharge on June 7, 2004, the military remains firmly in control in Aceh.No significant decisions can be taken withoutmilitary approval.At the handoverceremony in June, Governor Puteh himself reiterated that despite the province'schange of statusHOW MANY DEAD AND WOUNDED INACEH?Human Rights Watchcontacted Indonesian government representatives at the Indonesian Embassy tothe U.S, the Indonesian Embassy to the U.K, and the Indonesian Mission to theU.N, for official statistics on the number of GAM killed, captured, andsurrendered since the start of military operations in May 2003.Casualties occurring during an armed conflictare not in themselves evidence of violations of international humanitarian law;however gaps or ambiguities in reported figures may indicate an attempt to hideor distort war crimes.In July 2004 arepresentative from the Indonesian Mission to the U.N. responded that duringthe military operations 1,284 GAM had been killed, 1,520 had been captured, ofwhich 1,272 had been delivered to the local government for further processing,and 164 were freed for not having enough evidence against them.848 GAM had reportedly voluntarilysurrendered.The U.N. mission reportedthat 353 TNI and police officers had been killed or wounded.It also reported that 503 weapons had beenconfiscated.[12]The same month, the Indonesian Embassy in theU.S.offered wildly different numbers.Itwrote that since May 2003, 231 GAM had been killed, 94 members of GAM had beencaptured, and 112 members of GAM had voluntarily surrendered.[13]At thebeginning of May 2004, the military issued a statement stating that since May19, 2003, 1,963 GAM "rebels" had been killed, 2,100 arrested, and 1,276surrendered.The statement also saidthat 130 soldiers had been killed and 289 wounded since the offensive began.[14]The discrepancies havecontinued since the end of martial law.On July 21, 2004, Police Senior Commissioner Anjaya, spokesman for thecivil emergency authority in Aceh, announced that 232 alleged members of GAMhad died in clashes between May 19, 2004 and July 19, 2004.He added that nine soldiers and two policemenhad also been killed in the same period.[15]However, less than a week earlier, on July16, Aceh military chief Maj. Gen. Endang Suwarya stated that 400 "rebels" hadbeen killed since the lifting of the military emergency in Aceh in May 2004.[16]Non-governmentalorganizations on the ground, such as the Aceh branch of the respectedorganization Kontras, acknowledge that they are unable to collect data in thefield effectively.Accurate figures forcivilian casualties are difficult to determine, though all parties suggest thatcombatant and civilian casualties have been extensive.There is also an alarminglack of information regarding numbers of those wounded or what happens tothem.Typically in combat the number ofwounded exceeds the number of those killed.This dearth of information, in light of what we know about treatment ofdetainees generally, raises concerns about possible mistreatment of woundedcombatants and civilians by both sides.to a civil emergency, a number of regulations from themartial law period, including the decrees restricting access for foreigners tothe province, would still apply.TheChief of Army Staff, Endriartono Sutarto, also made it clear that there was noplan for the withdrawal of the Indonesian military (Tentara Nasional Indonesia,or TNI), but law enforcement responsibilities would be gradually handed over tothe police.[17]Military involvement in the fight against GAMwould continue.Given the limited nature of the handover to civilianauthorities and the fact that military operations continue on a large scale,there is little reason to believe that human rights and humanitarian lawviolations previously documented will decrease or stop now that the province isofficially under a civil, rather than a military, emergency.IV. Torture and Other Mistreatment of Prisoners andDetaineesIn that cell therewere many kinds of torture. Some was severe and some was light, but there wasalways torture.Adi, twenty-two year-old prisoner from Aceh[18]Graphic accounts of torture and other mistreatment wereshockingly common among Acehnese prisoners and detainess interviewed by HumanRights Watch.Many spoke credibly and atlength of their ordeals.Some displayedthe scars they received.All explainedthat it was the Indonesian military and/or police who subjected them to burningwith cigarettes, electro-shock, repeated kicking, and severe beatings while inpre-trial detention in Aceh.[19]Beatings appeared to be regular and common. Twenty-four out of the thirty-five peopleinterviewed told Human Rights Watch they had been tortured while in detention.Many of the people alleging torture told Human Rights Watchthat the torture occurred in an effort to gain either a written or oralconfession of GAM membership or other involvement with GAM.As described below, coercive efforts toextract confessions often lasted for days.In other cases torture was not as clearly linked to efforts to extractconfessions.In these cases the abusecontinued whether or not detainees acknowledged the accusations against them.The use of torture or coercion to extract confessions isillegal under Indonesian and international law.Article 421 of Indonesia'sCriminal Code states that, "Any official who in a criminal case makes use ofmeans of coercion either to force/compel a confession or to provoke astatement, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of four years."[20]International human rights and humanitarianlaw prohibit the use of torture and ill-treatment to obtain information; theConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment (the Convention against Torture), to which Indonesia is a party,requires states to "ensure that any statement which is established to have beenmade as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings."[21]In many cases, prisoners told Human Rights Watch that theyhad made false confessions to appease their interrogators so that beatingswould end. These same prisoners alsotold Human Rights Watch that they were unable to later recant these confessionsin court because of the lack of defense counsel, restrictions on their abilityto testify, or fear of the consequences of making allegations of torture incourt (see section V below entitled Violations of Due Process, Unfair Trials).Although torture has been an ongoing problem in Aceh, recentincidents can be traced to the first days of martial law. On May, 19, 2003, at 8 p.m., seven members of a Polsek (sub-districtlevel police) in West Aceh arrested a localresident.He told Human Rights Watchthat he was then taken to the police station and held for a month. While in police detention he says he was badlybeaten and tortured in order to extract a confession:They took me to the Polres [district level police] andbefore I had got out of the car one of the soldiers straight away hit me. For one week I was beaten and ordered to admitthat I was GAM but I did not confess it. After one week I finally confessed to it and Isaid "to what must I confess?"I didn'tdo anything I was accused of a murder, but it was not me but other people frommy village. They were wrong in who theyarrestedI was burnt on my chest and my shirt was taken off and poked withcigarettes [pungtung]. My body wasburnt with matches, they also skinned [menguliti]me with a knife.I was also kicked, hitwith a gun butt until I was bruised and vomited blood.[22]An Acehnese man told Human Rights Watch that he was arrestedby Kopassus officers during a military operation in his village on June 5, 2003. He described what happened:After I was arrested I was taken to an illegal post. It was a torture place. At that time I was interrogated and illtreated. They bound my hands and coveredmy eyes and I was hit repeatedly on my body, then they shocked me with electricityand I was abused until I was bruised. Iwas then taken to Lhokseumawe KP 3 [name of military post] for one night. When I got there they abused me until I wasunconscious. They questioned me aboutguns. And I said that I don't have anyguns. They also asked about my friends,and I said that I was not with any friends, I was alone. Then I was hit with some wood and the butt ofa gun. And this is the scar from thatabuse [showed interviewer a scar]. Afterone night at KP 3, the next day I was transferred to Lhokseumawe prison.[23]When asked about his torturers he said:The people who hit me were about 50 people and at thattime they were wearing army uniforms, and they were from a Kopassus unit.They were [carrying] guns and tortureinstruments.[24]Another Acehnese man was arrested on June 6, 2003, by policein CaneTown, sub-district Bulalas in AcehTengarra. He was in police detention fortwo weeks and then transferred to the barracks of the Brimob (mobile police brigade) unit from Medan. While at the Brimob barracks he was beatenbadly. He told Human Rights Watch:Without asking any questions they straight away severelybeat me, along with two other people who were detained with me, until my mouthwas really swollen, it was really sore, but in fact they kept on hitting,kicking, spitting on me.I felt reallyhumiliated, treated like that by themThey were wearing Brimob uniforms, amixture of uniforms, there were also some wearing Kopassus uniforms, there werelots of them.We were ordered to sit onthe floor and then beaten until bloody.[25]APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEGAL STANDARDSIndonesian and GAM forces in Aceh are bound byinternational humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war).The conflict in Aceh is considered to be anon-international (internal) armed conflict, for which the applicable lawincludes Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and thecustomary laws of war.[26]Common Article 3 provides for the humane treatmentof civilians and other persons not taking an active part in the hostilities(including captured members of opposing armed forces).Prohibited at all times are murder,mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; taking of hostages; outrages uponpersonal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; andsummary trials.Also prohibited are actsor threats of violence against the civilian population that spread terror orthe forcible removal of the civilian population without military necessity.International human rights law remains in effectduring an internal armed conflict.Thisincludes prohibitions on extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances,arbitrary arrest and detention, punishment without a fair trial, and unnecessaryrestrictions on the freedom of movement.Fundamental rights of life and liberty may not be infringed upon, evenduring a state of emergency.[27]International law prohibits torture and all cruel,inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.States are obliged to investigate all credible reports of torture.Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights prohibits torture andother forms of mistreatment.Torture isexplicitly prohibited under any circumstances by the Convention against Tortureand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Conventionagainst Torture), to which Indonesiais a state party.No exceptionalcircumstances, such as war, a threat of war, internal political instability ofany other public emergency, can be invoked as a justification of torture.In Indonesia,the Convention against Torture was brought into domestic law under Act No.5 of1998.This same man was then transferred to the Binjai policestation, where he was held for three days. While in police detention he claims he was tortured:For three days we slept standing up, naked, only in thetrousers that I am wearing. We were notallowed to sit even for a littlethey took my money, about Rp50,000, then theybought drink and Dji Sam Soe cigarettes. Then, with those cigarettes, they burnt mychest, until the fire had extinguished, and then I was ordered to inhale thecigarette so that the embers [menyala]came back, and I was burnt again. It waslike that until I was trembling/shaking [gemetaran]waiting to feel that burning.[28]Sopyani, the sixteen-year-old boy mentioned at the outset ofthis report, was detained by the TNI on June 9, 2003.Soon afterwards he was transferred to police custody. He told Human Rights Watch what happened tohim while in detention at a police station in Aceh:If it was the morning I was beaten by two men, if it wasthe evening I was beaten by the guard on duty. They hit me with some wood, one used the buttof a gun and one kicked me. I was beatenfor three days and three nightsand we were shocked with electric current.If you are against the TNI then you'retortured even more severely, and I was accused of being GAM. They consider that all Acehnese are GAM. So, while I was at the Polres the torture justcontinued without any ending.[29]When asked if he could identify his perpetrators he said:There were many, at that time I couldn't see anymorebecause my face was already swollen and blood was pouring off it. I felt really sick and my body wascontinuously hit with rifle butts and they kicked me, stamped on me. How could I see them while my eyes werealready shut by the flowing blood? Ididn't get their names, but they were verbally abusing [memaki-maki] me, and it wouldn't have done any good to ask.[30]Another man arrested in Aceh on June 15, 2003, told HumanRights Watch what happened to him at Lhokseumawe Police Station [Polres] afterhe was arrested:I was processed like an animal.They abused me until I was black and blue.Before, my uncle had also been arrested by the Kodim [district militarycommand] and he died when he was tortured, and I was also treated inhumanely. They hit me with a wood beam [balok] and a gun butt and they pouredwater over me, and every day I was hit. SometimesI could not eat, these are still the scars. [He pointed out his scars.]In fact until I fainted, after fainting theywould pour water over me again and hit me again. It was like that every dayI was at the policestation for more than one month.[31]A 42-year-old man told Human Rights Watch about his arrestand detention in Aceh:I was arrested on June 24, 2003. At the time I was a refugee [IDP], becauseother people in the community had fled and in my village there was often gunfighting between TNI and GAM, so we fled. When we got to the refugee place, we werequestioned at the post, one by one, then they said that I was illegal and I wasaccused of being GAM, and they also said that I was a [GAM] state taxcollector. At that time it was untrue,for sure I had helped before but only because I was forced to. After questioning at 2 o'clock in theafternoon I was taken to the Kodim [District Military Command]. At the Kodim we were questioned again there,and at the Kodim we were also abused, given electric shocks, beaten with ahammer on the head, and all of my body was sick and bleeding, we werecontinuously hit until bruised. Fourteendays in the Kodim, then taken to the Lhokseumawe prison and in the militarypolice, and then taken again to police station. At the police station I was accused of helpingGAM. Fourteen days in the police stationand then I was taken again to the prison. On August 22, 2003, I finally arrivedat the court.[32]A PATTERN OF TORTURE IN ACEHTorture and serious abuse of detainees in bothmilitary and police custody has long been routine practice in Aceh and much ofthe rest of Indonesia,particularly in conflict zones.In November 2001, following Indonesia's first reporton its efforts to implement the United Nations Convention against Torture, theU.N. Committee against Torture expressed its concern about "the large number ofallegations of acts of torture and ill-treatment committed by the members ofthe police forces, especially the mobile police units ("Brimob"), the army(TNI), and paramilitary groups reportedly linked to authorities, and in areasof armed conflict (Aceh, Papua, Maluku, etc.)."[33]The Committee also made recommendations on measuresthat should be taken by the Indonesian authorities to resolve this problem andto meet its obligations as a state party to the Convention againstTorture.They included amending thepenal legislation so that torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degradingtreatment or punishment are strictly prohibited under criminal law;establishing an effective, reliable, and independent complaint system toundertake prompt, impartial, and effective investigations intoallegations of ill-treatment and torture; reducingthe length of pre-trial detention; ensuring adequate protection for witnessesand victims of torture; excluding anystatement made under torture from consideration inany proceedings, except against the torturer; and inviting the U.N. SpecialRapporteur on Torture to visit Indonesia.[34]To date none of these recommendations have beenimplemented.An eighteen-year-old boy in one of the prisons in Central Java described the night he was taken intocustody by five marines who interrogated and tortured him.He was seventeen at the time of his arrest.I was arrested by marines on June 28, 2003, at midnight. They arrived in a group of ten, knocked on thedoor, and then straight away shot at the door of my house. I was then arrested and my eyes were covered.Then they took me with them and I don't know where. The next day when my eyes were uncovered, Iwas already at their post. That night Iwas tortured heavily and they asked about an act of arson and the whereaboutsof other GAM. I said I didn't know but Iwas still accused of being GAM. Theyabused me until I was black and blue and I was unconsciousThere was no time toexplain because they continuously asked questions and the answers were "yes" or"no." If you gave a different reasonthen you would be continuously hit, so then I just confessedIt was marines; atthat time there were 5 people who hit me, also someone who interrogated me, andthis was at the Bireuen post, the marines post.[35]One man told Human Rights Watch of his experience in June2003:When I arrived at the Kodim I was interrogated and thenbeaten, kicked, slapped, and like that, most of my body was abused until I wasblack and blue.Finally I was threatenedthat if I did not admit that I was GAM I would be killed. I do not know theirnames, I did not recognize them. They were from the Kodim. There were three men who tortured me. I wasabused alongside my friend, both of us beaten until black and blue, bloodflowing continuously and no medicine whatsoever.At the time I was interrogated I was ordered to admitthat I was GAM. I didn't want to becauseI'm not GAM, my work is only as a rice farmer. Because I didn't want to [admitto being GAM], I was beaten again, they just continued beating me in turns. I was beaten for about a week and threatenedthat if I did not confess to being GAM I would be killed. I was beaten in my chest until it was swollenand one of my bones was broken. Afterthat I was burned with cigarettes, then I was slashed with a knife until therewere wounds and while they were torturing me they also ordered me to confessthat I was GAM.After one week at the Kopassus post I was taken to the PolresWhenI got to the Polres I was tortured in the same way as at the Kopassus post. Some members of the police abused and torturedme, they also interrogated me. I was hitwith the butt of a gun, and I was tortured in a dark roomI was detained at thePolres for forty days. I wascontinuously beaten in my chest until blood came out of my mouth and I was sickfor a week, and they continued to punch me in my stomach. I was ordered to confess that I was GAM. I really didn't want to, because I am not GAM,but I was forced continuously. [Thislast group of torturers] were Brimob troops, they wore uniforms.[36]One man was arrested in June 2003 by members of TNIBattalion 143. He was initially taken toa TNI 143 Battalion post, but then transferred to the Kodim. He was held at the Kodim for seven days beforebeing moved to the Lhokseumawe prison detention centre (Rutan LP Lhokseumawe). Hedescribed what happened to him while at the Kodim:In the Kodim I was interrogated and they also hit me andseverely treated me.At the time I wasnot taken to the Polres because I was straight away questioned in the Kodim. During interrogation I was ordered to admitthat I was GAM, and I didn't admit it because I am not GAM. Then I was beaten until black and blueI wastortured and shocked with electricity and continuously ordered to admit that Iwas GAM, but I just did not want to admit this; it is obvious that I am just anordinary civilian.[37]Another man told Human Rights Watch that he was beaten inJune 2003 while in detention at the Polres [district level police station]. When asked about the perpetrators he said:The policemen who were at the Polresand those who were doing the beating, it was four men and theybeat us as well as interrogated us. Wewere ordered to confess that we were GAM, to fill in the BAP [policeinvestigation report]. It was given tous but I did not read it and we were immediately ordered to sign the BAP. Then this BAP was taken to the court, and Idon't even understand how this happened without any prior explanation. We were just ordered to sign it.[38]Another prisoner explained how he was repeatedly beatenduring the eight days he was in police detention:Sometimes they hit me with wood or a long roll, andsometimes we were kicked with military style boots.They did this until I was unconscious. My head, body, feet, chest, all over my bodywas sick and I collapsed. We were beatenuntil we were bruised and until now the scars are still there from when theybeat me, from when they were interrogating me.[39]Another man was unable to recall the exact date of hisarrest, but told Human Rights Watch:From the moment I was detained I was beaten in my chest,slapped, my body was abused completely. For40 days it was like that, I was beaten and ordered to confess that I was GAMbut I didn't want to because I am not GAM. But they continued to beat me. A soldier poured diesel oil over my body andthey kicked me. I was ordered to standup but I was unable to stand up again because my body was so weak. Then their commander told them not to beat meanymore and I was thrown into a cell. With that diesel oil, lots of people aretortured until they die. In that cell there were many kinds of torture. Some was severe and some was light, but therewas always torture. Those who carriedout the torture? It depended on theguard. But indeed there was one who wasreally evil, a man who was very hot tempered [beringas] and his task/duty was to continuously torture people.[40]A 45-year-old man was arrested by Kopassus soldiers andaccused of helping GAM.He told HumanRights Watch that he regularly paid off members of the security forces tosecure his business, but it was when GAM arrived, also demanding money, thathis troubles began. He explained:Every week I gave administration money to Brimob, aboutRp50,000 [US$5.40] and every month Rp200,000 [US$21.70], for the Polsek[sub-district police] every month Rp100,000 [US$10.85] and for the Koramil[sub-district military command] every month Rp240,000 [US$26]. In March some GAM members arrived to ask formonetary contributions and at that time I gave it to them, because I wasscared, I gave it only to secure my motorbike taxis [ojek] so that they were not taken by GAM. At that time I had two business rivals andthey were members of the police. Andthey reported that I helped GAM. Soldiersarrested me on May 22, 2003 just because I gave money to GAM, and I wasconsidered to be financially contributing to GAM. I was taken to the BKO Kopassus SGI post fortwo nights. The first day at 3 o'clock Iwas beaten, tortured and tied up. I waslike that for more than two hours. And now the scars are still sore. And I was also kicked with military boots [propos], I was tortured until I was unconscious.[41]Another man told Human Rights Watch:At the time I was questioned at the police station I wasinterrogated and also beaten, they hit me with a machine gun butt [bothi] on my back, and my head waskicked by a marine. Some policemantortured me severely, my hands were tied behind my back, my feet were also tiedusing just a normal rope and then I was interrogated and beaten and abuseduntil I was black and blue. Up to nowthe scars are still there. They orderedme to write a confession admitting that I am GAM because they had five guns asevidence. Even though those guns werenot mine, I had to write a letter in which I confessed. [42]Another man was held in detention in August 2003 at anunidentified, unofficial post for one week. During that time he was handcuffed andblindfolded and was unable to identify his perpetrators. After a week he was transferred to policecustody. He believes that the men who arrested and unofficially detained himwere from either the Polda [provincial level police] or the Kodim [districtmilitary command]. During his detentionhe was severely beaten. He told HumanRights Watch:I was ordered to confess to a Kapolda [Kepala Polisi Daerah,Head of provincial level police] bombing. When I did not confess they continued to beatme until I was black and blue. So, IconfessedThey hit me with a block of wood [balok],iron, the butt of a gun, and my head was smashed and this hand was broken, theycontinuously beat meIt was only because I was hit that I confessed.They said that if I did not confess I would"be taught another lesson" [disekolahkan,lit., "sent to school"].[43]An Acehnese man told Human Rights Watch that he had beenaccused of the bombing and burning of a Brimob house. At the close of his trial he was found guiltyof treason and sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. He told Human Rights Watch that he wasintimidated covertly [dari belakang, lit.,"from behind"]to not speak at hisown trial. No witnesses appeared at histrial. The confession he gave to Brimobsoldiers during his pre-trial detention at Bireuen prison appears to have beenthe only evidence against him. Hedescribed to Human Rights Watch what took place during his detention:I was ordered to acknowledge it [the bombing] and I wascontinuously hit and my hand was broken and I was continuously forced toconfess what I was accused ofIf I did not confess to it [the bombing] then Iwould be beaten continuouslyAfter they arrested me they took me to Bireuenprison where I was tortured and I was ordered to admit to something which didnot happen.They also ordered my friendwho was not guilty of anything [to confess]I am not GAMAt the time I wasquestioned I was ordered to confess that I was GAM and I was threatened I wouldbe killed if I did not want to confess it.[It was] members of Brimob. Brimobhit me and I was ordered to point out my friend and then they ordered me to saythat my friend is also a GAM member. ButI didn't want to and then they tortured me until I was bruised and finally Ihad to confess.[44]V. Violations of Due Process, Unfair TrialsI am sure not one of them [trials in Aceh] metinternational or even Indonesian standards. I have been told consistently that most peoplewere convicted on a limited number of witnesses, mostly police or militarywitnesses, who sometimes did not even present in court.[45]Foreign embassyofficial, JakartaOn July 21, 2003 Syamsul Syahputra became the first reportedalleged member of GAM to go on trial in Aceh since the start of martial law inMay 2003. Syahputra was charged withtreason, in the first of a series of trials apparently aimed at establishingthat GAM members were trying to break up the Republic of Indonesia.At the opening of his trial the stateprosecutor, Moch Adnan, stated that Syahputra, allegedly a district secretaryof GAM, "was trying to create revolt against the legal government with an aimto set up an independent state, separated from the Republic of Indonesia."[46]Since his trial hundreds of others have takenplace, largely unreported, and without independent monitors.According to the Indonesian military, over 2,000 Acehnesehave been arrested by Indonesian security forces in Aceh since the start ofmartial law in May 2003.Hundreds havebeen charged, tried, and convicted for makar(treason or rebellion) under Indonesia'scriminal code (Kitab Undang-Undang HukumPidana, or KUHP) and are now in prisons across Aceh and CentralJava.Under Indonesia'scriminal code a conviction for makarcan result in life imprisonment.Thecharges have generally been based on allegations of membership in, associatingwith, or assisting GAM, mostly for providing financial or other materialsupport for GAM.Human Rights Watch believes that many of those convictedunder martial law have been convicted primarily on the basis of confessionsextracted under torture or other ill-treatment and after trials that did notmeet international fair trial standards. Prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch inJava spoke at length about arbitrary arrests, lack of access to legal counsel,the failure of the prosecution to produce evidence or witnesses at trial,inability to contact defense witnesses, and, in many cases, restrictions on theability of defendants to speak at their own trial or to their own defensecounsel.On March 26, 2004, the widely respected Indonesian legal aidand human rights association, PerhimpunanBantuan Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia Indonesia(PBHI), held a press conference in Jakartato announce that they had found 43 cases of legal violations by law enforcementofficials in Banda Aceh, Aceh Besar, and Lhokseumawe between May 2003 andFebruary 2004.In a statement at theconference, Hendardi, then PBHI chairman, said, "We found a great many [casesof] arrests which were not carried out by police officers, which were madewithout written arrest warrants and then during interrogation [the detainees]were invariably tortured."[47]Charges of Treason and RebellionPersons arrested for their participation in, or support forthe GAM in Aceh, are typically charged with the crime of makar (treason or rebellion).The government seems to favor this catch-all offense, which usesextremely broad language and is punishable by up to life imprisonment, ratherthan to prosecute persons for specific offenses, such as weapons possession,kidnapping, or murder.Membership in GAMitself is not a violation of the law in Indonesia, as GAM is not an illegalorganization.[48]The crime of makaris listed in the KUHP under articles in a section entitled "Crimes Against theSecurity of the State" (KejahatanTerhadap Keamanan Negara).Articles106-108 of the KUHP state that:Article 106The attempt undertaken with intent to bring the territory ofthe state wholly or partially under foreign domination or to separate partthereof, shall be punished by life imprisonment or a maximum imprisonment oftwenty years.Article 1071)The attempt undertaken with the intent to causea revolution shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of fifteen years;2)Leaders and originators of an attempt referredto in the first paragraph shall be punished by life imprisonment or a maximumimprisonment of twenty years.Article 1081)Guiltyof rebellion and punished by a maximum imprisonment of fifteen years shall be:First, the personwho takes up arms against the government;Second, the person who, with theintent to rebel against the government, rises with or joins a band which takeup arms against the government,2)Leadersand originators of a rebellion shall be punished by life imprisonment or amaximum imprisonment of twenty years.[49]The majority of new prisoners in Aceh have been charged andconvicted of makar (treason orrebellion) under these articles.Thecharges filed against 140 of the 143 prisoners transferred from Aceh to Java inJanuary 2004 included makar; thecharges against 126 consisted solely of offenses under articles 106-108.[50]While Human Rights Watch was unable to access documentationregarding Acehnese prisoners other than this group of 143, in Java, Indonesianlawyers and human rights organizations monitoring the trials in Aceh told HumanRights Watch that most cases related to GAM involve charges of makar.Under the KUHP, there is no specified evidentiaryrequirement for makar.General rules of evidence under Indonesia'sCode of Criminal Procedure (KitabUndang-Undang Hukum Acara Pidana, or KUHAP) apply, whereby the judge has tohave at least "two legal evidence materials" to prove a conviction.[51]In addition, a person supporting GAM's objectiveto create a separate state should be considered guilty of makar only if the intention of the individual is made clear by anact specified under article 53 of the KUHP.[52]These provisions are vague and have historically been usedto target non-violent political activists across Indonesia.In the context of the armed conflict in Aceh,the open-ended language of the law has permitted convictions without a realdemonstration of wrongdoing. Mere association with GAM or allegations ofproviding material support to GAM membersas opposed to the organization aswholehas resulted in convictions in Aceh.Makar is oftenconstrued by the Indonesian security services and legal system to be the crimeof attempting to overthrow the government of Indonesia through support for GAM,without either the "two legal evidence materials" or the requisite act requiredby article 53 of the KUHP.In 1999 the United Nations Working Group on ArbitraryDetention visited Indonesia.In its report following the visit they drew particular attention to somearticles in KUHP and called for them to be amended. One group of articles raised were theprovisions related to crimes against the security of the state (Articles104-129).The Working Group stated that:Most of these provisions are, especially inasmuch as theintentional element of the crime is concerned, drafted in such general andvague terms that they can be used arbitrarily to restrict the freedoms ofopinion, expression, assembly and association. They can be used notably to target the press,peaceful political opposition activities and trade unions, as they werefrequently under the former regimes.[53]The definition of an act in support of GAM that constitutes makar is extremely elastic andsusceptible to abuse by security officials and prosecutors attempting to provea crime. Although GAM combatants whohave either been captured or have surrendered are among the detainees and prisonersin Aceh and Java, the detainee population also includes civilians who have beenaccused of supporting or sympathizing with GAM.The definition of support or sympathy is so broad that it includesfamilies of GAM members, as well as individuals who are opposed to Indonesiangovernment policy in Aceh, including human rights defenders, non-violent politicalactivists, and students. One defense lawyer from Aceh told Human Rights Watch:Generally speaking until now no commanders for GAM havebeen arrested or detained. The majorityare low-level or those forced to be GAM, forced trainings, etc. Many, for example, "couriers," or people whohave given rice or cigarettes to GAM.Itdoes not mean they are GAM but they are accused of helping GAM.[54]Arbitrary ArrestsPresidential Decree No. 23/2003, which took effect on May 19, 2003,authorized a state of emergency and martial law for AcehProvince.The province thereby became subject to theprovisions of martial law in Law No. 23/1959 on states of emergency, whichcovers both states of military and civil emergencies.This law states that the military has theauthority to arrest and detain suspects for 20 days, extendable by 50days.The detention must be reported tothe martial law authority within 14 days of the arrest.Even during a state of emergency, all arrests must be madewith an arrest warrant, unless the suspect is caught in flagrante delicto ("in the act").[55]Article 18 of the KUHAP states that:The task of making an arrest shall be executed by statepolice officers of the Republic of Indonesia by showing their assignment lettersand handing over to the suspect the arrest warrant which contains the suspect'sidentity and mentions the reasons for his arrest, and explains in brief thecriminal case of which he is suspect and his place of examination. If a person is caught in-the-act the arrestshall be made without a warrant, with the stipulation that the arrestingofficer must immediately hand over the arrested [person] and available evidencematerials to the nearest investigator or assistant investigator. A copy of the arrest warrant as intended insection (1) shall be delivered to the family of the arrested [person]immediately after the arrest"[56]International human rights law considers an arrest to bearbitrary if it violates existing legal procedures or includes elements ofinappropriateness, injustice or lack of predictability. The purpose of an arrest warrant is to providea judicial check on the powers of the police to ensure there is sufficientevidence to take a person into custody and to avoid arbitrary arrests.This process has failed in Aceh.Prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch provideddiffering accounts of the circumstances of their arrest and pre-trialdetention, indicating a lack of standardization in the legal process.Although most ended up in police detentionimmediately before trial, many were also held at military posts or barracksbefore being transferred to police or prison detention facilities.Much depended on which branch of the securityforces arrested them.Some were held inmilitary custody for several days or even weeks before being transferred topolice custody.However, they had one thing in common: none of the 35prisoners Human Rights Watch interviewed said that they were ever shown anarrest warrant or informed in writing at the time of their arrest of thecharges against them.One Indonesianlawyer who has monitored trials in Aceh in the last year told Human RightsWatch:From our own monitoring, 60% of the arrests are not validbecause [the suspects] were not arrested with an arrest warrant. They were like kidnappings."[57]Human Rights Watch interviewed one man who said that noarrest warrant was produced at the time of his arrest. He described what happened:An arrest warrant? No, there was none. At the time it was about 9 o'clock and they [the soldiers] arrived at myhouse. Then they knocked on my door, mynephew opened the door of the house and he was ordered to raise his hands, thenall of my family raised their hands because they [the soldiers] had guns. Then I was ordered to join them to the Kodim[District Military Command]. So I wentwith them to the Kodim, when I got to the Kodim I was detained for four daysand four nights, and during that detention I was beat up, hit until I was blackand blue. After they hit me then theyquestioned me.Another man described how he was arrested on June 10, 2003without an arrest warrant:At the time I was resting together with my family, thencame the sound of a car stopping in front of my house and then at that momentsome Kopassus soldiers straight away pushed the door of my house and destroyedinside my house until everything was in a mess, they took out clothes that werein the wardrobe saying "there are guns in here," but there were not any and atthat time my family were frightened. Thenthey [Kopassus] tied my hands behind me and I was straight away taken by themto the Kopassus post.[58]Another man recounted his arrest without a warrant:At the time I was arrested I was outside the town of Kuala Simpang.I was in a car when there was a "sweeping" bysecurity forces and I was ordered to get out of the car and show my ID card. Straight away I was arrested, together with myfriend, who is also here [in this prison]. Then I was taken by a group of marines andpoliceto Polsek Sungai Yu Aceh Tamiang. I was detained there for one night and thenext day I was taken to Polsek Langsa, East Acehand there I was detained for 40 days. ThenI was transferred to the prisonAt the time they were examining my ID card andtold me I was to be taken away, I asked "Sir, why do we have to go with you?"and he said "it will explained later in the office," and they snapped at us andsaid not to ask lots of questions. Assoon as we got to the office we were straight away accused of being GAM. If you are in Aceh, there is no otheraccusation, if you are arrested then you are GAM, and I asked again "Sir, whatis the reason you suspect me of being GAM, is there any evidence?" Again he said we were suspected of being GAM. Then I said again "I am not GAM, I am just anordinary citizen." Finally I was taken,and then without any resistance.[59]Another Acehnese man told Human Rights Watch what happenedwhen he was arrested:At the time [June 15, 2003] I was in my house and I wasarrested about 6 o'clock in the morning. After I was arrested I was put in a gunny sack[goni], my hands were tied, and myeyes were covered. Then they took me toI don't know where, I didn't even know. Andat that time I had been in the house by myself. After I was taken with them, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon my eyes,feet, and hands were freed, then I saw that I was already at the Lhokseumawepolice station.[60]Under the current civil emergency the military retains theauthority to arrest and detain suspects.However, since the downgrading of the province from a military to acivil emergency, arguments over applicable law and authority in Aceh havebroken out between the military and the police.The result has been that security officials have frequently failed tofollow Indonesian law, erroneously combining martial law and normal criminalcode procedures for arrests and detentions.[61]A defense lawyer from Aceh explained to Human Rights Watch:At the moment [April 2004] they [the security forces] areusing the military emergency regulations. One example: There is a TNI post in twovillages. There a person is suspected ofbeing GAM. He can be straight away taken into detention at a military post forup to 20 days then he is taken to military police for up to 50 days before heis taken to the police. At that pointthe [applicable] law changes to KUHAP. But that's already 70 days in detention.That's enough to brainwash [cuci otak]. During those 70 days there is a possibilitythat if no evidence appears then they will be disappeared. We have twenty cases of people who have beendisappeared until now.[62]Access to Counsel, Right to Prepare a DefensePersons arrested in Aceh on allegations of participating inanti-government activities or supporting GAM are frequently tried and convictedwithout adequate representation by legal counsel.Some persons have no lawyer whatsoever.Others receive court appointed lawyers who make no effort to challenge theprosecution's case or merely serve as go-betweens for the payment ofbribes.The result is that at trialdefendants often are left on their own, with no witnesses or other evidencepresented on their behalf.International human rights law guarantees that all personsdetained shall have the right of access to their legal counsel.[63] Personsarrested must have immediate access to counsel, which may be delayed onlybecause of exceptional circumstances as set out by law.[64]The right to counsel includes the rightto effective, qualified counsel who will represent the defendant's interestsand fully advocate on their behalf.[65]The KUHAP, the Indonesian code of criminal procedure,provides detailed provisions requiring notification of arrest, the filing ofcharges, and provision of a summons to the defendant before courthearings.These provisions aresystematically ignored.As recountedbelow, many prisoners told Human Rights Watch that they heard the chargesagainst them for the first time when they appeared in court or that they neverreceived a notice or summons.Thisdenies them the necessary time and opportunity to prepare a defense.The KUHAP ensures the right of free legal counsel tocriminal suspects who are indigent and face a sentence of five or more years ofimprisonment, or any suspect who faces a sentence of 15 years or more.[66]The legal assistance is required not just atthe trial but for "every level of examination."[67]The Acehnese charged with makar are entitled to free legal counsel, indigent or not, becausethe crime carries a sentence of up to life imprisonment.Yet all the prisoners interviewed by HumanRights Watch said that they had no access to legal counsel during most of theirpre-trial military or police detention.International experience has shown that the lack of involvement of legalcounsel during the period of pretrial detention has been shown to contribute toan atmosphere in which torture and other mistreatment flourish.In Aceh those that received counsel for theirtrial did not have adequate time to prepare a defense, and in practice many ofthe lawyers showed no inclination to mount a legal case on behalf of theirclients.An Indonesian NGO that monitored the trials in Aceh foundthat court documents were sometimes manipulated to give the appearance thatthere was a defense lawyer at the trial when none was present.Said a worker for the organization: "Thereare many cases without a defense lawyer but the documentation has a falsifiedsignature."[68]In some cases defendants were appointed legal defense by thecourt.The legal assistance they weregiven was described as pro forma rather than a genuine defense. A man who was tried in Lhokseumawe told HumanRights Watch about the defense lawyer at his trial:At that time there was a defense lawyer who was appointedby the judge. But actually there was nodefense at all. He was just silent. He said this was so that the punishment wouldbe a little bit lighter [ringan].[69]In some cases detainees were restricted from speaking totheir appointed counsel during the trial.Another man explained:Actually we were given a defense lawyer, but also we werenot allowed to use the defense lawyer. Theysaid we could not use a defense lawyer.When asked who instructed him that he was not allowed to usethe defense lawyer, he said:The prosecutor said so, he said we could not use adefense lawyer, and the prosecutor also did not give a reason why we could notuse a defense lawyer. And during thetrial we were not allowed to speak and we were restrained. At the time we really wanted to defendourselves, but what could be done?[70]Another man told Human Rights Watch:There was a defense lawyer, but from the policeI couldnot say very much. What is certain isthat I only could be quiet because everything had already been arranged/settled[diatur] by them. And I also could not speak with the defenselawyer because there were restrictions which had been fixed by them.[71]In July 2003 the problem of inadequate defense counsel forGAM detainees in Aceh was raised by an Indonesian lawyers' organization withthe Indonesian government, including during a meeting with Vice PresidentHamzah Haz and Minister for Justice and Human Rights Yusril Mahendra.Indra Sahnun Lubis, chairman of theAssociation of Indonesian Lawyers (IPHI), stated: "We are concerned with thegovernment's failure to provide defense lawyers for the separatists since mostof them have been convicted or are facing conviction for crimes that carry aprison term of more than five years."Lubis also told the press that while IPHI was able toprovide some minimal defense support for trials in Aceh, Vice President Haz hadpromised to pay attention to the issue so that defense counsel could beprovided to GAM detainees on trial in Aceh.In response, Justice Minister Yusril Mahendra conceded that the lack oflegal defense in Aceh was a problem and admitted that his office had notallocated sufficient funding to provide legal counsel for all of the trials inAceh.He recommended that "the fundsshould come from the joint operation budget, as it is impossible for my officeto provide the money."[72]Despite these public acknowledgements by senior governmentofficials of problems with access to counsel, over a year later little concreteaction has been taken to address this vital problem.Unfair TrialsThe trials of Acehnese charged with treason and otherpolitical offenses do not meet international fair trial standards.In addition to defendants' lack of legalcounsel and the opportunity to prepare a defense, trials typically deny thedefendant the right to question witnesses for the accused and to call andexamine defense witnesses.Persons maybe convicted with little or no evidence presented, bringing into seriousquestion the competence, impartiality, and independence of the courts.[73]The full extent of unfair trials in Aceh is unknown in largemeasure because of the difficulty local human rights monitoring organizationsface in Aceh.For the most part treasontrials are held in rural areas away from the relative safety of the largertowns.Security threats against humanrights defenders from both the Indonesian security forces and GAM make itextremely difficult for defense counsel to do their jobs effectively. One Jakartaorganization involved in trying to gather information on the Aceh trials toldHuman Rights Watch about the enormity of the task:We don't yet have any information about specific cases. We are still waiting on data from colleaguesin AcehTo be specific about the Aceh cases it is not possible to carry outmonitoring like that. The issue is thethreat from the government against human rights defenders. What is definite is that for our efforts inBanda Aceh there are only three people from LBH Aceh,one from PBHI in the Aceh Besar area. Butto go out to the districts, we cannotand the majority of these caseshappen in the districts.So,automatically we don't have any information.[74]In explaining the process leading up to his trial, and thetrial itself, one man captured many of the serious problems in the trials ofthose accused of makar forGAM-related activities:I didn't have a defense lawyer, and none was given to me.They said I was indicted for treason sowhy did I need a defense lawyer? At thetime I also asked if there was anyone who would defend me, but none was givenby the judge.[75]According to the man, the trial itself was conducted withoutany witnesses or evidence presented:The people who made the BAP [the police investigationreport] for the trial was a group from the Kodim itself.After I was processed in the Kodim I wasstraight away sent to Lhokseumawe [detention centre].Fifty days after that I was handed over tothe Polres. After Lhokseumawe Polresthen I was tried. I was tried in a court, two trial sessions. At the first one the KUHP [criminal codecharges] were read.At the secondsession I was sentenced.It was TNI whoarrested me, and the witness was submitted from a TNI group but the person didnot arrive. The judge did not tell mewhy the witness did not arrive and there was no evidence. The prosecutor demanded four years in prisonfor me. After it was decided in the session, I was hit with three years inprison. I was indicted under article 108with the accusation I am a GAM adjutant.Truthfully this is not true. ButI was ordered to admit because it was fitting with the confession that had beenput in the BAP.[76]Another man explained that after he was arrested he wastaken to the police station. While atthe police station he was only asked his name and employment, information hegave freely. He was therefore surprisedby developments at his trial. He recounted what happened:During the trial it was really different from what hadbeen asked at the Polres, and the BAP which the prosecutor read was extremelydifferent. At the Polres no one said Iwas guilty of anything. In my statement,I only said that I had taken in two of my friends to sleep in my house. But during the trial the judge read in the BAPthat I was accommodating GAM, and at that time I didn't know that my friendswere alleged to have been involved with GAM. I didn't know that, but I was charged withtreason anyway.In many cases the only evidence offered by the prosecutionwas a suggestion of an association with GAM.One defense counsel from Aceh told Human Rights Watch:For the trial process the majority of cases were triedwithout the presence of witnesses. Or,there were witnesses but from the police who are fighting there and they onlyconfirmed to the judge that he [the defendant] is GAM.[77]In some cases no proof at all was presented.One 34-year-old prisoner told Human RightsWatch:At the time of the trial I didn't call any of my ownwitnesses but the judge himself pointed out a witness. Then the witness said that neither of us wereinvolved in anything. If this trial wasvalid, I did not have a problem, I defended my own rights and I did not have adefense lawyer and I did not have any of my own witnesses, everything wasregulated by them.I was not scaredbecause I had not done anything wrong and I kept saying that I was not GAM, andthat witness said I was not involved in anything.[78]The man was nevertheless convicted.A 22-year-old man described his trial:At the time I had three witnesses and the head of thevillage was also a witness for me and he said that I was not involved with GAM,then the other witnesses also said that I was not involved with GAM. I didn't have a defense lawyer. At the time the village head was a witness forme and he knows that I am not GAM and I stated I was not GAM. But what can you say, the punishment hadalready been decided.[79]A 29-year-old man told Human Rights Watch:I was in court two times and the judge straight away madehis decisionthere was no evidence, and no witnesses. I was the only one on trial. During the first court appearance I did nothave a lawyer, but at the second session there was a lawyer. The judge sentenced me to six years in prison.Because I had a lawyer it was decreasedto five yearsI am scared to appeal because my sentence may be lengthened. It is better to just accept the judge'sdecision.[80]A 45-year-old man told Human Rights Watch:It is because we don't know about politics, and there wasno pity and I was accused with articles 106-108, a treason case. And I did not appeal. On September 2, 2003, in mytrial there was one prosecutor, two judges, and me, and my wife sat behind meIhad three witnesses and I asked if my witnesses could be present. They said that it was not allowed to arrangefor them, if I didn't want my punishment to be harsher.I asked why it was this way, why the trial was closedlike this, didn't I also have a right to ask for the presence of my witnesses. It is impossible for a trial to be like this,and the trial was unclear. They said Iwas hardheaded. On the 2nd,after I spoke for a little bit, the judge straight away banged the gavel. I was straight away sentenced to 5 years inprison.After that the trial was closed.One 28-year-old man from Bireuen told Human Rights Watchthat he was arrested by Brimob and police officers while he was walking on theroad. They checked his KTP [I.D] andarrested him immediately in connection with a school burning near his house,where he worked as a cleaner. He toldHuman Rights Watch that he did not burn the school and instead was one of themen who had helped put the fire out. Duringthe four sessions of his trial he was too afraid to present his case to thejudge. He had no defense lawyer. He said that only himself, the prosecutor, andthe judge were present during the trial.He explained:How could I have explained it [my case], in that trialeverything had already been settled and I could not say anything because I wasscared that my punishment would increase. And they said that they already had all thedata, and at that time I also asked for that data but they didn't give it tomeI was sentenced to eleven years in prison by the judge.[81]Several prisoners alleged that in addition to abuse theysuffered while in detention, military and police officials warned them torefrain from speaking in their own defense or pursuing other judicial optionsat the close of their trial.One man told Human Rights Watch:I did not have my own lawyer except the lawyer paid forby the government. I had already beenthreatened by soldiers [not to contest the charges], so I didn't do anything. Ijust accepted whatever the judge decided.[82]Another man explained:At trial I contested the charges and lots of TNI/Polriarrived. I was threatened that I wouldbe killed. And I maintained I was notGAM, because I am only an ordinary fisherman [The judge] just listened, andthen I was returned to the cell. I wassentenced to five years in jail under articles 106-108 for treason, after threetrial sessions. I had a defense lawyer, from the government, but he put upalmost no defense. In truth I [initially believed I would] be released by thejudge but then a group of BKO troops [BawahKendali Operasi, the designation of auxiliary forces from outside Acehnominally placed under local command] arrived at the prison and threatened me,saying: "If you are free you will be shot." These three men from BKO Kopassusthreatened me in the prison and deliberately sent TNI/Polri to the trial totake revenge. So finally I chose not to appeal, just to accept the judge'sdecision.[83]There is a widely held belief among convicted personsimprisoned in Java that the conduct of their trials in Aceh was politicallymotivated and the judges lacked the independence to rule fairly. Whenquestioned about why he had not defended himself more aggressively during histrial, one man told Human Rights Watch:How can we dispute, when the judge himself is threatened[terancam]If it is a GAM case it'sfor sure that the punishment given to us will not be light. If we had given asingle pack of cigarettes to GAM then the punishment will be heavier. It isalready clear it is not just and it does not make sense. Everything has alreadybeen engineered by the authorities [parapenguasa] in Aceh.[84]The perception that the outcome of trials had beendetermined in advance by the martial law administrator was widely held amongthe prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch.The resignation and acceptance of harshsentences and the widespread reluctance to appeal reflects this. One eighteen-year-old explained whyhe did not appeal his three-and-a-half-year sentence:It is no use for me to appeal because if I appeal then mypunishment will increase and the punishment has already been decided by themartial law administrator.[85]Another man told Human Rights Watch:I didn't have a defense lawyer. A defense lawyer forwhat? I did not do anything wrong and I could do it [defend] myself. What wouldyou use a defense lawyer for when the sentence had already been determined bythe authorities [penguasa]? For surethere was an offer from the judge [to appoint counsel] but I didn't want one.[86]One Indonesian defense lawyer from Aceh told Human RightsWatch that the judges could play a more effective role in stemming abuses, butchoose not to:First, the judges or the prosecutors who are assigned toAceh are non-permanent. I mean that they originate from outside of Aceh. Sotheir psychology is that they don't want to stay in Aceh for a long time. Theywant to do things quickly so that they are not too long in Aceh. Second, thequality of the indictments is weak, they are not strong One of the judges toldme, if they give out a light sentence for treason they receive areprimand/warning [teguran] from themilitary. It's not a threat but it is enough for the judge to think twice if hewants to give out a light punishment.[87]Judges and prosecutors have been brought into Acehspecifically for GAM-related trials.They are largely from other areas of Sumatraor Java. One Indonesian human rights defender from Aceh, who is monitoring thetrials, told Human Rights Watch:It is part of the integrated operationsthe lawenforcement operation [operasi penegekanhukum]because actually there were only a few judges and prosecutors inAceh before [the mass arrests started]. Also the salaries of judges andprosecutors brought in from the outside are higher, because of theirassignment. It was the decision of the Minister for Justice and Human Rights.Normally they are assigned to Aceh for six months.[88]Persons convicted of treason or other political offenses inAceh have difficulty appealing verdicts arising from unfair trials.Indonesian law permits courts to raise aswell as lower sentences on appeal.Prisonersand defense lawyers told Human Rights Watch that this provision, combined withthe lack of impartiality and independence of the courts handling treason casesin Aceh, strongly deterred appeals.Persons who did appeal were believed likely to have their sentencesincreased rather than reduced.One man who was sentenced to eight years in prison oncharges of treason told Human Rights Watch why he wasn't appealing the verdict:My defense lawyer told me to just accept my sentencewhatever it was because if I appealed my punishment likely would just getheavier. [The prosecutor told my defense lawyer that] he was also sorry for mebut [he had to do it] because of his duty, and threats on him. So I shouldaccept the decision whatever it is. And I don't know about the law, and Ididn't go to school.[89]CorruptionThe Indonesian criminal justice system is notorious forwidespread corruption, permitting those with money and influence to escapejustice while depriving many defendants of the right to a fair trial.In Aceh, where the government has prosecutedhundreds of people in the last year for alleged treason or rebellion againstthe state, corruption still thrives in detention facilities and in the courtsof law.Human Rights Watch uncoveredevidence of corruption among police and judicial officers in Aceh. Defendantswere exposed to requests for bribes from police officers, prosecutors, defenselawyers, and judges. Several prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch saidthat many detainees in Aceh were able to buy their way out of convictions orpay to decrease their sentences.Otherstold Human Rights Watch that the only reason they were in prison was becausethey did not have enough money to buy their freedom.One man explained how his sentence reduction was arrangedafter his conviction:I was sentenced to four years in prison. I asked for alighter sentence of three years in prison but I had to pay a Rp2, 500,000(US$270) bribe. Just to decrease to three years the money had to be paid to theprosecutor and the judge, just so the punishment could be decreased. Then Iasked what if I paid until my money ran out, but the prosecutor said I couldn'tdo that.[90]Another man told Human Rights Watch that while in policedetention at the Lhokseukon Polsek:I was treated with deceit, and I was ordered to confesssomething which I didn't doif I didn't confess it in a report I would be hit,even though I was hit I refused to confess. I only admitted that I gaveRp240,000 to GAM, and that was it. And the prosecutor asked for Rp10 millionfrom me. But really I didn't have any money and at the time I was at the Polsekfor 50 days and 50 nights.[91]One man was severely beaten while in both military andpolice custody. He told Human Rights Watch:For one week I was tortured at the torture post and thenI was transferred to the Polres. After I arrived at the Polres I was alsobeaten and I was ordered to confess, and then I gave some money [to the police]so that the prosecution dossier [berkasperkara] would be sent to the court quicker, so that I would not be beatenany more.[92]At the end of his trial this 23-year-old man was sentencedto fifteen years in prison by the judge for treason. The sentence was latercommuted to eleven years in prison. The conviction was largely based on aconfession the man made while in military custody after being severely torturedand beaten. When asked if he would appeal the sentence, then man said:THE FIVE GAM NEGOTIATORSFive GAM negotiators whohad represented GAM during peace-talks with the Indonesian government beforethe collapse of the ceasefire in May 2003 were arrested in Aceh.The five were detained on their way to theairport on May 16, 2003, as they were due to fly to Japan to attend last ditch peacetalks aimed at rescuing the deteriorating ceasefire.In response to diplomatic protests, policefreed them as the Tokyotalks began but then rearrested them when negotiations broke down.The arrest of the GAMnegotiators was in violation of international law.International humanitarian law prohibitsperfidy.Protocol I to the GenevaConventions specifically states that it is perfidious to capture an adversaryby "feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce."[93]The prohibition against the use of perfidyapplies to internal armed conflicts as a matter of customary international law.The five men were subsequently put on trialin Aceh.In September 2003 Amni binAhmad Marzuki, Teuku Muhammad Usman, Sofyan Ibrahim Tiba, Teuku Kamaruzaman,and Nashiruddin Ahmad were convicted and sentenced to between 12 and 15 yearsin prison for treason under the KUHP and terrorism under Indonesia's newanti-terrorism legislation. Subsequent appeals were unsuccessful and in June,2004, Indonesia'sSupreme Court upheld their convictions.The indictments statedthat the negotiators knew that GAM had an armed movement, a governmentstructure, and had obtained funds from the public which were used for theiractivities. GAM offenses cited in the indictment included several bombings,murders, kidnappings, and arson acts allegedly carried out by the organizationsince December 2002.During the trial,prosecutors did not directly accuse the negotiators of violence, but statedthat they "gave assistance to GAM to oppose the authority of the Republic of Indonesiaresulting in an atmosphere ofterror or widespread feelings of fear among people."The presiding judge in one of the trials,Maratuo Rambe, stated "The defendants have caused unrest among the people. Theyalso tried to separate (Aceh) from Indonesia." Maratuo said the threedefendants in his case were charged with terrorism since they knew of killings,bombings, and abductions but they did not report them to the authorities.[94]At the end of the trialsthe Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, which had facilitated theceasefire agreement, voiced concern over the arrest and convictions of thenegotiators, stating: "In addition to our concern for these individuals, we areworried by the potential negative implications this may have for opportunitiesfor dialogue in Aceh and elsewhere.Itmay dissuade individuals from coming forward to negotiate and resolve conflictthrough dialogue."[95]During his trial, SofyanIbrahim Tiba submitted a complaint that he was ill-treated and threatened whilein custody. In late August 2004 the group was transferred to Java but, due tohis ill health, Sofyan Ibrahim Tiba remained in Aceh.I was sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the judge,and I did not accept it and at the time I also submitted a legal defense, andfinally the judge sentenced me to eleven years in prison. I will not appeal,because I really don't have any money, and in fact if I appeal then mypunishment will increase.[96]VI. Detention and Prison FacilitiesAfter the declaration of martial law in Aceh the Indonesiangovernment announced plans to use NasiIsland, off the coast of Aceh, as a detention site for arrested and surrenderedGAM fighters and supporters. There were immediate comparisons in theinternational press to the U.S detention facility at GuantanamoBay in Cuba. But, in fact, Indonesiahas a long history of using some of its thousands of islands as prisons anddetention facilities. BuruIsland in the Maluku region of Indonesia was home to many of Indonesia's political prisoners inthe aftermath of the attempted 1965 coup that led to the ousting of PresidentSukarno. Atauro island off the north coast of East Timor, was also used as apenal colony for East Timorese after Indonesia invaded the territory in1975.[97]The issue of where to house the thousands of anticipated GAMprisoners was clearly a problem when martial law was imposed in May 2003. Indonesiawas preparing for large scale arrests but lacked the capacity to implement thispart of the "integrated operation" properly without detention centers, extralegal resources, and prison space. There was also an acknowledgement that itwas unfeasible and undesirable to convict and imprison the entire captured orsurrendered population. Alleged GAM members had started to surrender toauthorities, and at the beginning of July 2003 a temporary detention camp inBanda Aceh, consisting of five tents, was already housing ninety-ninedetainees.[98]However, by July 2003, the NasiIslandproposal had run out of steam, with an apparent lack of funds and politicalsupport blamed for the failed effort. Indonesian Armed Forces Commander,General Endriartono Sutarto told journalists, "Perhaps it would be moreefficient if we rehabilitate [detainees] rather than use NasiIsland."[99] Soon afterthis the idea of "re-education" centers became policy.In January 2004 the first graduates of Aceh's "re-education"centers were released. A total of 438 former GAM members and supporters becamethe first to complete a five-month government "re-education" program. Graduateswere allowed to return home but had conditions put on their release. They hadto report to their district governments as well as to local military andpolice, ask for permission from local authorities if they wished to changetheir residence, and were prohibited from leaving Aceh. Major General EndangSuwarya told reporters that the graduates would be watched: "We will form aspecial team to monitor their development so we can know how successful this "re-education"is, because it's the first."[100]During the five months in the "re-education" center inmateswere given mandatory sessions in the basic principles of the Indonesian state,including the state ideology Pancasila. Military police and provincialofficials were responsible for training not only state loyalty, but also tradessuch as fishing, farming, and tailoring.[101]Before returning home, the graduates were also required to take an oathdeclaring that they had ceased to belong to GAM, and had submitted to the idealof the Unitary Republic of Indonesia.On leaving the centers the graduates were given Rp 2.5million (US$275) each, as seed capital to start businesses in their homedistricts. Major General Endang Suwarya told journalists that the five-monthreeducation course had cost more than Rp 2 billion (US$220,000) in taxpayers'money.[102]Since January more graduates have completed "re-education"at three established camps in Aceh. It is estimated that 1,200 people have sofar attended the training courses in the three camps.[103]Crucially entry is limited to those who have voluntarily surrendered toauthorities, and to those deemed not to have held senior positions with GAM.One senior diplomat in Jakartatold Human Rights Watch "the treatment in the "re-education" centers is beingmonitoredwhat is happening is not that badvisitors to these camps think thatthey [detainees] are well looked after, there are no signs of obvious abuse andconsiderable attempts at rehabilitation."[104]While there may not be any signs of visible abuse, thecriterion for entry and graduation from these centers is ambiguous. Without anyclear legal mechanism for establishing the guilt or otherwise of inmates, thecenters run the risk of being seen as extra-judicial internment facilities.Some press and NGO accounts question the motivation for people to voluntarilysurrender to authorities in Aceh. Fear of Indonesian security authorities ispervasive in Aceh. It is possible that voluntary surrender is seen as a saferoption than running the risk of arbitrary detention or arrest by Indonesiansecurity forces. What is clear is that the treatment of those arrested,detained, and convicted is often severe, and the prospect of such treatment maywell be less palatable than five months in a "re-education" center.Transfers to JavaIn January 2004, Minister for Justice and Human RightsYusril Mahendra announced that prison overcrowding in Aceh had prompted adecision to transfer some Acehnese prisoners to prisons in CentralJava.The transfer wasapplicable to those sentenced to prison terms of three years or higher.The 143 prisoners selected for the first transfer from Aceharrived in Central Java by Hercules militaryplanes on January21, 2004. The prisoners arrived wearing blue prison uniforms andwere handcuffed and chained together at the hands and ankles.[105] As oflate July, it was believed that fifteen transferees were children.[106]Most of the Acehnese prisoners transferred to Java have beensent to maximum security prisons on Nusa Kambangan island off Java's southerncoast and prisons in and around Semarang, on thenorth coast of Central Java.Although Aceh's jails are indeed overcrowded, so are prisonsin Java.One possible reason behind themove was to isolate prisoners from family and GAM members in Java in a bid toweaken GAM's infrastructure and communications. There has also been speculationthat GAM prisoners were transferred to Java to prevent them from indoctrinatingother prisoners in Aceh.Although Justice Minister Mahendra vehemently denied anypolitical reasons for the transfers, then Coordinating Minister for Politicaland Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told reporters, "IncarceratingGAM members outside Aceh is a government policy for dealing with state securityconvicts or those involved in separatist movements, based on national securityinterests."[107]GAM officials in Sweden reacted angrily to thetransfers.On January 26, 2004, theyargued that the transfers amounted to exiling of Acehnese from Aceh inrepetition of tactics used by the Dutch East Indiescolonial administration.[108]The widely respected Jakarta Post made the same argument in an article.[109]Justice Minister Mahendra responded that, "Anewspaper has cynically said that we are aping the approach of the Dutch East Indies colonial administration. That is nottrue. This is not exile; the justice and human rights ministry has nothing todo with politics."[110]A lawyer from Aceh told Human Rights Watch:The official reason from the government is to eradicatetheir [the GAM detainees] ideology. Secondly the lack of detention facilitycapacity in Aceh. But, really it is more consistent with the first point.Endang Suwarya [martial law administrator] often says things like that. Themilitary emergency from before had a plan to make NasiIsland a kind of Guantanamo, but there wasn't enough money. Itis cheaper to transfer them to Central Java byHercules.[111]Prisoners told Human Rights Watch that the transfers havecaused an enormous amount of trauma and resentment. The majority of thoseinterviewed told Human Rights Watch that they were unaware of plans to transferthem until the last minute. This meant that very few prisoners were able toinform their family members of their transfer or see them before theirdeparture. One man described the morning of his transfer:At 8 o'clockin the morning we were taken out of the prison, but that was normal.Then arrived the news that I was ordered toget ready, they said I was going to be transferred.Straight away I asked, "Where am I going tobe transferred to, sir?"He said toLhokseumawe [in Aceh] and that was very sudden.At that time there were four of us and I asked again, "Why didn't yousay that to us yesterday?" and he said that he also didn't know.We were transferred to Lhokseumawe.After we arrived in Lhokseumawe, myself and afriend were summoned by the military police and I asked, "Is it true we will betransferred to Java" and he said "Yes, it's true you will be transferred," andI was really panicked and didn't know how to say anything, should I send aletter to my family or not?But it wasnot possible that I could do anything because it was sudden and I did notexpect that I would be here [Java] now. Before, I thought they were pretending,just to frighten me, but it really has happened.[112]Another man told Human Rights Watch:At the time of departure me and some other friends wereordered to prepare because we were going to be sent to Java island, and Ididn't have a chance to send the news to my wife that I would be sent to Javaand maybe my wife does not even know that I was already transferred. On January 25, 2004we were lined up, and then hands, feet, and our bodies were tied with chain andwe were sent to Java on a Hercules.[113]Another man explained how he felt:I was transferred in January 25, 2004 and at the time ourhands, feet, and bodies were tied and we were ordered to get on a truck, thenwe left for the airport and flew here [Java]. The first time we were taken toLP Bireuen, after that transferred to LP Banda Aceh.At that time there were 33 of us taken andour sentences were very different, some with three, four, five, six years.The highest sentence was six or seven yearsand even one with ten years. I thought that maybe we were people who would be"disappeared" because at the time of our departure it was like they were hidingus, really early in the morning, and they seemed to be scared in casejournalists found out. I really don't know why it was like thisWe didn't askthem because we were treated like goats who were being taken to, I don't knowwhere, and we were tied just like animals. At the time I was very sad and Ijust submitted to my fate. If you want to speak, you must go where? Even in thetrial we were not listened to, so what about outside the trialI do not wantto take the risk, even though I am not guilty.Yeah, what can I say? It is better to just be quiet than to be dead.[114]In July 2004 the Indonesian government announced moretransfers of prisoners, from Aceh to Kalimantanand East Nusa Tenggara.[115]Rule 44(3) of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners provides that "[e]very prisoner shall have the right toinform at once his family of his imprisonment or his transfer to anotherinstitution."[116]Restrictions on Family Visits"Now I don't knowanymore how my family is and they also do not know how I am here [inJava].I only wish to Allah SWT that ourhopes are protected."Twenty-eight-year-old prisoner from Aceh[117]For many prisoners the transfer to Java is the first timethey have spent an extended period away from their families[118]and the first time they have traveled outside of Aceh. One twenty-year-old man was visibly distraughtby the process of his trial and subsequent transferal to Java. When asked aboutwhether or not he had had any contact with his family since his arrival inJava, he said:There has not been any because it is really difficult andI am very sad because I cannot meet with my family, and I even don't know howmy family is at this moment.My wish isto be returned to Aceh even though it is very bitter there. At night I alwayscry remembering my family in Aceh.[119]Another man told Human Rights Watch:I really long for my family, but what to do? It is onlyheld in my heart. I have already sent a letter to my village but until nowthere has not yet been a reply. I really miss my family but what can be done?My sentence has not yet finished and I have to go along with this punishment asit has been decided. I have four children, the oldest is in class 3 SLTP andthe youngest has just turned ten months. It was only a week after my wife gavebirth that I was arrested.[120]One eighteen-year-oldtold Human Rights Watch:The question of my family? We are already far apart nowand I have only sent a letter to my family, I have just recently sent a letterto my family, even if they want to visit me, how could they do that? It is faraway, so I can only just pray.[121]Even those who have accepted their convictions and arewilling to serve out their sentences are confused and angered by the transferto Java. One man told Human Rights Watch:For me everything is normal [in Java], what is definiteis my wish, if it's possible, that we can just be returned to Aceh and just berehabilitated there, because if we are in Aceh we are close to ourfamilies.Indonesia is just fine because wedo not want to be considered as rebels.We are only ordinary civilians who every dayjust look for a life which is calmer and pleasant. We do not want Acehto continue to be in turmoil.[122]Rule 37 of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatmentof Prisoners states that "[p]risoners shall be allowed under necessarysupervision to communicate with their family and reputable friends at regularintervals, both by correspondence and by receiving visits."[123]VII. RecommendationsTo the Government of IndonesiaTreatment in DetentionThepresident, the armed forces commander, and other senior public officialsshould publicly condemn torture and other forms of mistreatment indetention.
