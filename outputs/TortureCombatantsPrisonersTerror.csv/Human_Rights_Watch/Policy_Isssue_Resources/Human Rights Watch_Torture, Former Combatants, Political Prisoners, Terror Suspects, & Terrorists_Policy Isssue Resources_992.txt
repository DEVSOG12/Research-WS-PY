If officers witness all these thingshappening, and don't take action, there's something wrong. If another WestPointer tells me he thinks, "Well, hitting somebody might be okay," there'ssomething wrong.- 82ndAirborne officer, describing confusion in Iraq concerning allowableinterrogation techniquesI. SummaryResidents of Fallujah called them "the Murderous Maniacs"because of how they treated Iraqis in detention. They were soldiers of the U.S.Army's 82nd Airborne Division, 1st Battalion, 504thParachute Infantry Regiment, stationed at Forward Operating Base Mercury (FOBMercury) in Iraq.The soldiers considered this name a badge of honor.[2]One officer and two non-commissioned officers (NCOs) of the82nd Airborne who witnessed abuse, speaking on condition ofanonymity, described in multiple interviews with Human Rights Watch howtheir battalion in 2003-2004 routinely usedphysical and mental torture as a means of intelligence gathering and for stressrelief.One soldier raised his concernswithin the army chain of command for 17 months before the Army agreed toundertake an investigation, but only after he had contacted members of Congressand considered goingpublicwith the story.According to their accounts, the torture and other mistreatmentof Iraqis in detention was systematic and was known at varying levels ofcommand.Military Intelligencepersonnel, they said, directed and encouraged army personnel to subject prisoners to forced, repetitiveexercise, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness, sleep deprivation for dayson end, and exposure to extremes of heat and cold as part of the interrogationprocess. At least one interrogator beat detainees in front of othersoldiers.Soldiers also incorporateddaily beatings of detainees in preparation for interrogations.Civilians believed to be from the CentralIntelligence Agency (CIA) conducted interrogations out of sight, but notearshot, of soldiers, who heard what they believed were abusive interrogations.All three soldiers expressed confusion on the properapplication of the Geneva Conventions on the laws of armed conflict in thetreatment of prisoners.All had servedin Afghanistan prior to Iraq and said that contradictory statements by U.S. officials regarding the applicability ofthe Geneva Conventions in Afghanistanand Iraq(see Conclusion) contributed to their confusion, and ultimately to how theytreated prisoners. Although nonewere still in Iraqwhen we interviewed them, the NCOs said they believed the practices continue.The soldiers came forward because of what they described asdeep frustration with the military chain of command's failure to view theabuses as symptomatic of broader failures of leadership and respondaccordingly. All three are active duty soldiers who wish to continue theirmilitary careers.A fax letter, e-mail,and repeated phone calls to the 82nd Airborne Division regarding themajor allegations in the report received no response.When the Abu Ghraibscandal broke in April 2004, senior officials in the Bush administrationclaimed that severe prisoner abuse was committed only by a few, rogue, poorlytrained reserve personnel at a single facility in Iraq.But since then, hundreds of other cases ofabuse from Iraq and Afghanistan have come to light, described in U.S.government documents, reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross,media reports, legal documents filed by detainees, and from detainee accountsprovided to human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch.[3]And while the military has launched investigations and prosecutions oflower-ranking personnel for detainee abuse, in most cases the military has usedclosed administrative hearings to hand down light administrative punishmentslike pay reductions and reprimands, instead of criminal prosecutions beforecourts-martial.The military has made noeffort to conduct a broader criminal investigation focusing on how militarycommand might have been involved in reported abuse, and the administrationcontinues to insist that reported abuse had nothing to do with theadministration's decisions on the applicability of the Geneva Conventions orwith any approved interrogation techniques.These soldiers'firsthand accounts provide further evidence contradicting claims that abuse ofdetainees by U.S.forces was isolated or spontaneous.Theaccounts here suggest that the mistreatment of prisoners by the U.S. militaryis even more widespread than has been acknowledged to date, including amongtroops belonging to some of the best trained, most decorated, and highlyrespected units in the U.S. Army.Theydescribe in vivid terms abusive interrogation techniques ordered by MilitaryIntelligence personnel and known to superior officers.Most important, theydemonstrate that U.S.troops on the battlefield were given no clear guidance on how to treatdetainees.When the administration sentthese soldiers to war in Afghanistan,it threw out the rules they were trained to uphold (embodied in the GenevaConventions and the U.S. Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation).Instead, President Bush said only thatdetainees be treated "humanely," not as a requirement of the law butas policy.And no steps were taken todefine what humane was supposed to mean in practice.[4]Once in Iraq, their commanders demandedthat they extract intelligence from detainees without telling them what wasallowed and what was forbidden.Yet whenabuses inevitably followed, the administration blamed only low-ranking soldiersinstead of taking responsibility.These soldiers'accounts show how the administration's refusal to insist on adherence to alawful, long-recognized, and well-defined standard of treatment contributed tothe torture of prisoners.It also showshow that policy betrayed the soldiers in the field-sowing confusion in theranks, exposing them to legal sanction when abuses occurred, and placing in animpossible position all those who wished to behave honorably.* * *The officer and NCOs interviewed by Human Rights Watch saythat torture of detainees took place almost daily at FOB Mercury during theirentire deployment there, from September 2003 to April 2004. While two of thesoldiers also reported abuses at FOB Tiger, near the Syrian border, the mostegregious incidents allegedly took place at FOB Mercury.The acts of torture and other cruel orinhuman treatment they described include severe beatings (in one incident, asoldier reportedly broke a detainee's leg with a baseball bat), blows and kicksto the face, chest, abdomen, and extremities, and repeated kicks to variousparts of the detainees' body; the application of chemical substances to exposedskin and eyes; forced stress positions, such as holding heavy water jugs witharms outstretched, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness; sleepdeprivation; subjecting detainees to extremes of hot and cold; the stacking ofdetainees into human pyramids; and, the withholding of food (beyond crackers)and water.According to ArmyField Manual 19-4 covering enemy prisoner of war operations, Military Policehave responsibility for safeguarding, accounting for, and maintainingcaptives.The soldiersinterviewed by Human Rights Watch said that established procedure was violatedby having frontline soldiers guard and prepare detainees for interrogation,instead of speeding detainees to a rear area where they would be looked afterby trained Military Police.Detainees in Iraqwere consistently referred to as PUCs.This term was devised in Afghanistanto take the place of the traditional designation of Prisoner of War (POW),after President Bush decided that the Geneva Conventions did not applythere. It carried over to Iraq,even though the U.S.military command and the Bush administration have continually stated that theGeneva Conventions are in effect. Although not all persons captured on abattlefield are entitled to Prisoner of War (POW) status, U.S. militarydoctrine interprets the GenevaConventions as requiring that all captured persons be treated as POWs unlessand until a "competent tribunal" determines otherwise.[5]Detainees at FOBMercury were held in so-called "PUC tents, which were separated from therest of the base by concertina wire.Detainees typically spent three days at the base before being releasedor sent to Abu Ghraib. Officers in theMilitary Intelligence unit and officers in charge of the guards directed thetreatment of detainees.Soldiers told usthat detainees who did not cooperate with interrogators were sometimes deniedwater and given only crackers to eat, and were often beaten.There was little done to hide themistreatment of detainees:one of thesoldiers we interviewed observed torture when he brought newly captured Iraqisto the PUC tents.The torture of detainees reportedly was so widespread andaccepted that it became a means of stress relief for soldiers.Soldiers said they felt welcome to come tothe PUC tent on their off-hours to "Fuck a PUC" or "Smoke a PUC.""Fucking a PUC" referred to beating adetainee, while "Smoking a PUC" referred to forced physical exertion sometimesto the point of unconsciousness.Thesoldiers said that when a detainee had a visible injury such as a broken limbdue to "fucking" or "smoking," an army physician's assistant would be called toadminister an analgesic and fill out the proper paperwork.They said those responsible would state thatthe detainee was injured during the process of capture and the physician'sassistant would sign off on this.Brokenbones occurred "every other week" at FOB Mercury."Smoking" was notlimited to stress relief but was central to the interrogation system employedby the 82nd Airborne Division at FOB Mercury.Officers and NCOs from the MilitaryIntelligence unit would direct guards to "smoke" the detainees prior to aninterrogation, and would direct that certain detainees were not to receivesleep, water, or food beyond crackers.Directed "smoking" would last for the 12-24 hours prior to aninterrogation.As one soldier put it:"[the military intelligence officer] said he wanted the PUCs so fatigued, sosmoked, so demoralized that they want to cooperate."The soldiersbelieved that about half of the detainees at CampMercurywere released because they were not involved in the insurgency, but they leftwith the physical and mental scars of torture."If he's a good guy, you know, now he's a bad guy because of the way wetreated him," one sergeant told Human Rights Watch.The soldiers with whom Human Rights Watch spoke had servedas guards in Afghanistan and had observed interrogations at FOB Tiger in Iraq,and said that civilian interrogators at those locations had also used coercivemethods against prisoners.Theseinterrogators were always referred to by the U.S. military abbreviation OGA,which stands for "Other Government Agencies."It was assumed that such persons were with the CIA, but because OGA alsoincludes other civilian agencies, the soldiers with whom Human Rights Watchspoke said they could not be sure.Soldiers generally had less direct access to OGAinterrogations, in part because OGA personnel often took detainees to anisolated building and were generally more careful about being seen.But the soldiers who had watched OGAinterrogations in Afghanistansaid that soldiers applied in Iraqsome of the techniques they learned from the OGA, including forced stresspositions, sleep deprivation, and exposure.At FOB Tiger, the officer said, he heard the sounds of physical violencecoming from rooms where OGA interrogations were being held, but without beingpresent in the room could not know whether the sounds were real orsimulated.The soldiers said thatcivilian interrogators sometimes removed prisoners from detention facilitiesand took the paperwork that indicated a detainee was being held, apparently"disappearing" that detainee.[6]The officer who spoke to Human Rights Watch made persistentefforts to raise concerns he had with superior officers up the chain of commandand to obtain clearer rules on the proper treatment of prisoners.When he raised the issue with superiors, hewas consistently told to keep his mouth shut, turn a blind eye, or consider hiscareer. When he sought clearer procedures from general officers, he was toldmerely to use his judgment.Altogether this officer said he spent 17 months trying toclarify rules for prisoner treatment while seeking a meaningfulinvestigation.He explained at lengthhow he openly had brought his complaint directly up the chain-of-command, fromhis direct commanding officer, to the division commander, to the Judge AdvocateGeneral's (JAG) office, and finally to members of the U.S. Congress.In many cases, he was encouraged to keep hisconcerns quiet; his brigade commander, for example, rebuffed him when he askedfor an investigation into these allegations of abuse.He believes he was not taken seriously untilhe began to approach members of Congress, and, indeed, just days before thepublication of this report he was told that he would not be granted a pass tomeet on his day off with staff members of U.S.Senators John McCain and John Warner.He said he was told that he was being naveand that he was risking his career.Human Rights Watch welcomes reports that the Army has agreedto investigate the abuses discussed in this report.We are concerned however those investigationswill only focus on low-level soldiers and officers, instead of looking as faras necessary up the chain of command.Weare also concerned that military personnel who come forward to report abuseswill find their careers suffer, as their commanding officers implied theywould, rather than be commended for doing their duty.If FOB Mercury is not to become one more in an expandingseries of U.S. detention facilities associated with brutality and degradingtreatment, further tarnishing the reputation of the U.S. armed forces, thepolicy failures must be faced head-on and the most senior responsible officialsheld accountable.Accordingly, Human Rights Watch urges the following:TheU.S. Attorney General should appoint a special counsel to investigate any U.S. officials-no matter their rank orposition-who have participated in, ordered, or had command responsibilityfor war crimes or torture, or other prohibited ill-treatment againstdetainees in U.S.custody.[7]TheU.S. Congress should create aspecial commission, along the lines of the 9/11 commission, to investigatethe issue of detainee abuse by U.S. military and civilians personnelabroad, including the incidents described here, as proposed inlegislation sponsored by Senator Carl Levin.Congressshould enact legislationalong the lines proposed bySenators John McCain, Lindsay Graham, and John Warner, which wouldprohibit any forms of detainee treatment and interrogation notspecifically authorized by the U.S. Army Field Manual on IntelligenceInterrogation, and not consistent with the Convention AgainstTorture.Such legislationmust cover not only military units but also civilian agencies involved ininterrogations, such as the CIA.The U.S. Departmentof Defense should conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations made inthis report at all levels of the chain of command. Such an investigation mustnot be limited to lower-ranking enlisted personnel and officers, but mustinclude higher-ranking officers and civilian officials linked to policies thatdirected, encouraged or tolerated such abuse.Measures should be taken to ensure that soldiers who bringforward credible allegations of detainee abuse are not in any way punished fortheir actions.The 82ndAirborne Division should implement measures to ensure the immediateinvestigation of credible allegations of detainee abuse.Note on Presentation of the Soldiers' AccountsAll three accounts below consist of direct quotes from the soldiers. Each of thesoldiers was interviewed more than once.For the sake of clarity and to avoid repetition, Human Rights Watch hasedited and rearranged specific passages in the accounts.II. Account of Sergeant A, 82nd AirborneDivisionSergeant A servedin Afghanistan fromSeptember 2002 to March 2003 and in Iraq from August 2003 to April2004.Human Rights Watch spoke with himon four separate occasions in July and August 2005.In retrospect what we did was wrong, but at the time wedid what we had to do.Everything we didwas accepted, everyone turned their heads.We got to the camp in August [2003] and set up.We started to go out on missions rightaway.We didn't start taking PUCs untilSeptember.Shit started to go bad rightaway.On my very first guard shift formy first interrogation that I observed was the first time I saw a PUC pushed tothe brink of a stroke or heart attack.At first I was surprised, like, this is what we are allowed to do?This is what we are allowed to get awaywith?I think the officers knew about itbut didn't want to hear about it.Theydidn't want to know it even existed.Butthey had to.On a normal day I was on shift in a PUC tent.When we got these guys we had them sandbaggedand zip tied, meaning we had a sandbag on their heads and zip ties [plasticcuffs] on their hands.We took theirbelongings and tossed them in the PUC tent.We were told why they were there.If I was told they were there sitting on IEDs [Improvised ExplosiveDevices, homemade bombs] we would fuck them up, put them in stress positions orput them in a tent and withhold water.The "Murderous Maniacs" was what they called us at ourcamp because they knew if they got caught by us and got detained by us beforethey went to Abu Ghraib then it would be hell to pay.They would be just, you know, you couldn'teven imagine.It was sort of like I toldyou when they came in it was like a game.You know, how far could you make this guy goes before he passes out orjust collapses on you.From stresspositions to keeping them up fucking two days straight, whatever.Deprive them of food water, whatever.To "Fuck a PUC" means to beat him up.We would give them blows to the head, chest,legs, and stomach, pull them down, kick dirt on them.This happened every day.To "smoke" someone is to put them in stress positionsuntil they get muscle fatigue and pass out.That happened every day.Somedays we would just get bored so we would have everyone sit in a corner and thenmake them get in a pyramid.This wasbefore Abu Ghraib but just like it.Wedid that for amusement.Guard shifts were four hours.We would stress them at least in excess oftwelve hours.When I go off shift andthe next guy comes we are already stressing the PUC and we let the new guy knowwhat he did and to keep fucking him.Weput five-gallon water cans and made them hold them out to where they got musclefatigue then made them do pushups and jumping jacks until they passed out.We would withhold water for whole guardshifts.And the next guy would too.Then you gotta take them to the john if yougive them water and that was a pain.Andwe withheld food, giving them the bare minimum like crackers from MREs [MealsReady to Eat, the military's prepackaged food].And sleep deprivation was a really big thing.Someone from [Military Intelligence] told us these guysdon't get no sleep.They were directedto get intel [intelligence] from them so we had to set the conditions bybanging on their cages, crashing them into the cages, kicking them, kickingdirt, yelling.All that shit.We never stripped them down because this isan all-guy base and that is fucked up shit.We poured cold water on them all the time to where they were soaking wetand we would cover them in dirt and sand.We did the jugs of water where they held them out to collapse all thetime.The water and other shitstart[ed] [m]aybe late September, earlyOctober, 2003.This was all at CampMercury,close to the MEK base[8] like 10minutes from Fallujah.We wouldtransport the PUCs from Mercury to Abu Ghraib.None of this happened in Afghanistan.We had MPs [military police] attached to usin Afghanistanso we didn't deal with prisoners.We hadno MPs in Iraq.We had to secure prisoners.[Military intelligence] wants to interrogatethem and they had to provide guards so we would be the guards.I did missions every day and always came backwith 10-15 prisoners.We were told byintel that these guys were bad, but they could be wrong, sometimes they werewrong.I would be told, "These guys wereIED trigger men last week."So we wouldfuck them up.Fuck them up bad.If I was told the guy was caught with a 9mm[handgun] in his car we wouldn't fuck them up too badjust a little.If we were on patrol and catch a guy thatkilled my captain or my buddy last weekman, it is human nature.So we fucked them up bad.At the same time we should be held to ahigher standard.I know that now.It was wrong.There are a set of standards.Butyou gotta understand, this was the norm.Everyone would just sweep it under the rug.What you allowed to happen happened.Trends were accepted.Leadership failed to provide clear guidanceso we just developed it.They wantedintel.As long as no PUCs came up deadit happened.We heard rumors of PUCs dyingso we were careful.We kept it to brokenarms and legs and shit.If a leg wasbroken you call the PAthe physician's assistantand told him the PUC gothurt when he was taken.He would getMotrin [a pain reliever] and maybe a sling, but no cast or medical treatment.In Afghanistanwe were attached to Special Forces[9] and sawOGA.We never interacted with them butthey would stress guys.We learned howto do it.We saw it when we would guardan interrogation.I was an Infantry Fire Team Leader.The majority of the time I was out onmission.When not on mission I wasriding the PUCs.We should have had MPs.We should have taken them to Abu Ghraib[which] was only 15 fucking minutes drive.But there was no one to talk to in the chainit just got killed.We would talk among ourselves, say, "This isbad."But no one listened.We should never have been allowed to watchguys we had fought.FOB Mercury was about as big as a football field.We had a battalion there with three or fourcompanies and attachments.We lived inthe buildings of an old Iraqi military compound that we built up with barriers,ACs [air conditioners], and stuff.Wehad civilian interpreters on post and contractors came every day to fixshit.The contractors were local Iraqis.The PUCs lived in the PUC area about 200 metersaway.It had a triple-strength circleconcertina barrier with tents in the middle with another triple-strengthconcertina perimeter.Inside each was aHesco basket that is wire that normally has cloth in it.We filled them with dirt to make barriers andsome we emptied and buried to use as access points for the Iraqis.This was all inside the confines of the FOB.There was a guard tower behind the PUC tentwith two guards.One was always lookingat the PUC tent.We never took directfire but did take regular rocket and mortar attacks.We did not lose anyone but had shrapnelinjuries.On their day off people would show up all the time.Everyone in camp knew if you wanted to workout your frustration you show up at the PUC tent.In a way it was sport.The cooks were all US soldiers.One day a sergeant shows up and tells a PUCto grab a pole.He told him to bend overand broke the guy's leg with a mini Louisville Slugger that was a metal bat.He was the fucking cook.He shouldn't be in with no PUCs.The PA came and said to keep him off the leg.Three days later they transported the PUC toAbu Ghraib.The Louisville Slugger[incident] happened around November 2003, certainly before Christmas.People would just volunteer just to get theirfrustrations out.We had guys from allover the base just come to guard PUCs so they could fuck them up.Broken bones didn't happen too often, maybeevery other week.The PA would overlookit.I am sure they knew.The interrogator [a sergeant] worked in the[intelligence] office.He was formerSpecial Forces.He would come into thePUC tent and request a guy by number.Everyone was tagged.He wouldsay, "Give me #22."And we would bringhim out.He would smoke the guy and fuckhim.He would always say to us, "Youdidn't see anything, right?"And wewould always say, "No, Sergeant."One day a soldier came to the PUC tent to get hisaggravation out and filled his hands with dirt and hit a PUC in the face.He fucked him.That was the communications guy.One night a guy came and broke chem lights[10] open andbeat the PUCs with it.That made themglow in the dark which was real funny but it burned their eyes and their skinwas irritated real bad.If a PUC cooperated Intel would tell us that he wasallowed to sleep or got extra food.Ifhe felt the PUC was lying he told us he doesn't get any fucking sleep and getsno food except maybe crackers.And hetells us to smoke him.[Intel] would tellthe Lieutenant that he had to smoke the prisoners and that is what we were toldto do.No sleep, water, and justcrackers.That's it.The point of doing all this was to get themready for interrogation.[Theintelligence officer] said he wanted the PUCs so fatigued, so smoked, sodemoralized that they want to cooperate.But half of these guys got released because they didn't do nothing.We sent them back to Fallujah.But if he's a good guy, you know, now he's abad guy because of the way we treated him.After Abu Ghraib things toned down.We still did it but we were careful.It is still going on now the same way, I amsure.Maybe not as blatant but it is howwe do things.Each company goes out on a mission and you kick the doordown and catch them red handed.Wecaught them with RPGs [rocket propelled grenades].So we are going to give you specialattention.We yank them off the truckand they hit the ground hard, maybe 5-6 feet down.We took everything and searched them.Then we toss him in the PUC tent with asandbag on his head and he is zip tied.And he is like that all day and it is 100 degrees in that tent.Once paperwork was done we started to stressthem. The five-gallon water can was full of water.We would have people hold out their arms oneach side parallel to the ground.Aftera minute your arms get tired and shake.Then we would take some water out and douse them to get them cold.And the tent is full of dust and they getdirty and caked with it.Then we makethem do pushups and jumping jacks.Atthe end of a guard shift they look like zombies.We had these new high-speed trailer showers.One guy was the cleaner.He was an Iraqi contractor working onbase.We were taking pretty accuratemortar fire and rockets and we were getting nervous.Well one day we found him with a GPS[11] receiverand he is like calling in strikes on us!What the fuck!?We took him butwe are pissed because he stabbed us in the back.So we gave him the treatment.We got on him with the jugs and doused himand smoked and fucked him.III. Account of Sergeant B, 82ndAirborne DivisionSergeant B servedin Afghanistan fromSeptember 2002 to March 2003 and in Iraq from August 2003 to April2004. Human Rights Watch spoke with him on two separate occasions in August2005.I was an infantry squad leader doing mounted patrols andconducting raids in Iraq.I would catch the bad guys.You heard a lot of stuff as a squad leader incharge of guys watching PUCs about guys mistreating PUCs.We got to Mercury on the 6th ofSeptember.We came from working inal-Qaim.In late September we started totake on PUCs as part of our mission.Since we were capturing them we would detain them for no more than threedays, three days max, to interrogate them for intel.We had a mechanized company attached to uswhich took us up to about battalion strength, maybe 750 people when you includethe HHC [headquarters].PUCs were placed in a GP [general purpose] medium orsmall tent, about 20x15, and that is being generous.We had 2-3 tents with no more than 10-15 PUCsper tent with a couple guards to a tent.You added guards if you had more PUCs.We would immediately put these guys in stress positions.PUCs would be holding hands behind theirbacks and be cuff tied and we would lean their forehead against a wall tosupport them.As far as abuse goes I saw hard hitting.I heard a lot of stories, but if it ain't meI wouldn't care.I was busy leading mymen.I did hear about [a sergeant]breaking PUC bones.Stories came out onmission.Guys were always talking aboutwhat they did to the PUCs.Guysmentioned stuff but I couldn't care less what happened at the PUC tent a weekago.Putting guys with frustration incharge of prisoners was the worst thing to do.I also saw smoking.They would get the PUCs to physically exert themselves to thelimit.Feeding was a huge issue and itwas brought up.The PUCs wouldn't eatwhat we were feeding them as they were against Americans and MREs, so all I sawthem eat were crackers. [Sergeant A told Human Rights Watch that PUCs wereoften only fed crackers.It is unclearwhy Sergeant B believes the detainees had a choice.]Rest was also an issue.We were told they could be interrogated 45 minutes on, 15 minutes offfor sleep and whatever, but I was not regularly in the PUC tents.I brought the PUCs in for interrogation.That is when I saw whatever I saw.Intel had some bad guys and we all know sleepdeprivation is a powerful tool.In Iraq,from the beginning, we messed up on the treatment soldiers had to endure whileguarding prisoners.There are five "S's"[Search, Silence, Segregate, Speed (to the rear), Safeguard] and we blew Speedand Security.Speed was the biggestproblem.Speed means you get them to therear to process them.You need to getthem away from the troops they are trying to kill.The Geneva Conventions is questionable and we didn't knowwe were supposed to be following it.In Afghanistan youwere taught to keep your head down and shoot.You never thought about the Geneva Conventions.There was an ROE [Rules of Engagement] and itwas followed, same in Iraq.But we were never briefed on the GenevaConventions.These guys are notsoldiers.If we were to follow theGeneva Conventions we couldn't shoot at anyone because they all look likecivilians.IV. Account of Officer C, 82nd AirborneDivisionC is an officerwith the 82nd Airborne Division and West Point graduate who servedin Afghanistan from August2002 to February 2003 and in Iraqfrom September 2003 to March 2004. HRW spoke with him more than two dozen timesin July, August, and September 2005. Below are excerpts from those interviewsgrouped by subject matter (the subject headings were supplied by Human RightsWatch).At FOB Mercury, hewas not in charge of interrogations but saw several interrogations in progressand received regular reports from NCOs on ill-treatment of detainees. He feltstrongly that abuses there reflected larger policy confusion about what waspermitted, and that the officer corps in particular has a duty to come forwardand take responsibility.On Conditions at FOB MercuryWhen we were at FOB Mercury, we had prisoners that werestacked in pyramids, not naked but they were stacked in pyramids.We had prisoners that were forced to doextremely stressful exercises for at least two hours at a time which personallyI am in good shape and I would not be able to do that type of exercises for twohours. There was a case where a prisoner had cold water dumped on him and thenhe was left outside in the night.Again,exposure to elements. There was a case where a soldier took a baseball bat andstruck a detainee on the leg hard. This is all stuff that I'm getting from myNCOs.In the PUC holding facility you could have had peoplethat could have been in the wrong house at the wrong time brought in an all ofa sudden they are subjected to this. So that's a big problem, obviously a hugehuman rights issue.It's army doctrine that when you take a prisoner, one ofthe things you do is secure that prisoner and then you speed him to the rear.You get him out of the hands of the unit that took him. Well, we didn't dothat.We'd keep them at out holdingfacility for I think it was up to seventy-two hours.Then we would place him under the guard ofsoldiers he had just been trying to kill.The incident with the detainee hit with baseball bat; he was suspectedof having killed one of our officers.[At FOB Mercury] they said that they had pictures thatwere similar to what happened at Abu Ghraib, and because they were so similarto what happened at Abu Ghraib, the soldiers destroyed the pictures.They burned them.The exact quote was, "They [the soldiers atAbu Ghraib] were getting in trouble for the same things we were told to do, sowe destroyed the pictures."On Frustration Obtaining a Meaningful Responsewithin the Military Chain of CommandI witnessed violations of the Geneva Conventions that Iknew were violations of the Geneva Conventions when they happened but I wasunder the impression that that was U.S. policy at the time. And assoon as Abu Ghraib broke and they had hearings in front of Congress, theSecretary of Defense testified that we followed the spirit of the GenevaConventions in Afghanistan,and the letter of the Geneva Conventions in Iraq and as soon as he said that Iknew something was wrong. So I called some of my classmates [from West Point], confirmed what I was concerned about andthen on that Monday morning I approached my chain of command.I talked to an officer in the Ranger regiment[12] and hisresponse was, he wouldn't tell me exactly what he witnessed but he said "Iwitnessed things that were more intense than what you witnessed," but it wasn'tanything that exceeded what I had heard about at SERE school.[13]After that I called the chaplain at WestPoint who I respected a lot and I talked to him about some thingsand we were on the same page.Then I hadsaid well, "I'm going to talk to my company commander and then my battalioncommander on Monday."My company commander said, "I see how you can take itthat way, but" he said something like, "remember the honor of the unit is atstake" or something to that effect and "Don't expect me to go to bat for you onthis issue if you take this up," something to that effect.I went and talked to my battalion commander.Again, he clearly thinks he has done theright things and that what I am bringing attention to is within the standardsand that he is okay.He didn't dismissme.He just said "Go talk to JAG. We'llwork this out."It wasn't alarming tohim in any way, shape or form that these things had happened.So I went to JAG andhe says, "Well the GenevaConventions are a gray area."So Imentioned some things that I had heard about and said, "Is it a violation tochain prisoners to the ground naked for the purpose of interrogations?" and hesaid, "That's within the Geneva Conventions." So I said, "Okay.That is within the Geneva Conventions." Andthen there is the prisoner on the box with the wires attached to him, and tome, as long as electricity didn't go through the wires, that was in accordancewith what I would have expected USpolicy to be and that he wasn't under the threat of death.And he said, "Well, that is a clear violationof the Geneva Conventions." And I said, "Okay, but I'm looking for some kind ofstandard here to be able to tell what I should stop and what I should allow tohappen."And he says, "Well, we've hadquestions about that at times."Then he said, "There was a device that another battalionin the 82nd had come up with that you would put a prisoner in.It was uncomfortable to sit in." And he wentto test it out by sitting in it and he decided that it wasn't torture.I hear this and I am flabbergasted that thisis the standard the Army is using to determine whether or not we follow theGeneva Conventions.If I go to JAG andJAG cannot give me clear guidance about what I should stop and what I shouldallow to happen, how is an NCO or a private expected to act appropriately?When I talked to [an official in the Inspector General'soffice about the policy confusion on what was permitted] he says, "Youobviously feel very upset about this, but-I don't think you're going toaccomplish anything because things don't stick to people inside the Beltway [Washington, D.C.]."He says, "I worked at the Pentagon and thingsdon't stick to people inside the Beltway."When the Secretary of the Army came [to my training], Iaddressed him on numerous issues, which I don't want to go into. One of thoseissues was treatment of prisoners.Imentioned that I didn't have clear guidance, and the Secretary of the Armysaid, "Well, we realized that that was a problem but you are a little bitbehind the times.We've solved thatmatter.And I didn't get a chance torespond to that.I should have, I shouldhave pressed that issue a lot harder.That's one of my regrets.Justbringing up the issue at all was stressful, but it hasn't been resolved becausethere is no clear guidance.And throughdiscussions with other officers the problem is not taken care of.It really is multiple problems. It's twoproblems.One is the Army handlinginterrogations and the other is the relationship between OGA and prisoners andwhat they can and can't do.The officer also spoke with multiple experts on the U.S. military Law of Land Warfare, his peers,and his soldiers, all of whom, he said, expressed concern that the GenevaConventions were not being applied in Iraq.He decided to bring his concerns to theCongress since he felt they were not being adequately addressed by his chain ofcommand. Days before this report was published his brigade commander told himto stop his inquiries; his commanding officer told him that he could not leavethe base to visit with staff members of Senators McCain and Warner withoutapproval and that approval was being denied because his commanding officer feltthe officer was being nave and would do irreparable harm to his career.On Policy Confusion within the Ranks on CoerciveInterrogation[In Afghanistan,]I thought that the chain on command all the way up to the National CommandAuthority[14] had madeit a policy that we were going to interrogate these guys harshly.[The actual standard was] "we're not going to follow theGeneva Conventions but we are going to treat you humanely."Well, what does humane mean?To me humane means I can kind of play withyour mind, but I cannot hit you or do anything that is going to cost youpermanent physical damage. To [another officer I spoke with] humane means it'sokay to rough someone up and to do physical harm.Not to break bones or anything like that butto do physical harm as long as you're not humiliating him, which was the way heput it.We've got people with differentviews of what humane means and there's no Army statement that says this is thestandard for humane treatment for prisoners to Army officers.Army officers are left to come up with theirown definition of humane treatment.I don't know for sure [how high up the hierarchyresponsibility for the abusive treatment lies]. What I know is that it'swidespread enough that it's an officer problem. It's at least an officerproblem. You make the standard, and that is what goes up to the executivebranch. You communicate the standard, that's when it's somewhat the executivebranch, but then it comes more into the officer branch, and enforcing thestandard is the officer branchAnd inthe Schlesinger report[15] it evensays that when the President made the decision that al-Qaeda wasn't going to becovered by the Geneva Conventions, there was a clear danger that it was goingto undermine the culture in the United States Army that enforces strictadherence to the law of land warfare. That's in the Schlesinger report.But anyway, the President makes that decision, anddecides that we're not going to cover them by the Geneva Conventions, whichaccording to the letter of the law, I think there's a strong argument forthat. [But] then that lack of standard migrates throughout the Army. Itfilters throughout the Army, so that now the standard, this convoluted, "You'llknow what's right when you see it," filters through the whole Army.If you draw a hard line and you say "Don't do anythingbad to prisoners," like you bring them in, you give them food, you give themwater, and then you leave them alone. If that happens then, yeah, that is aneasy line to draw, but when you start drawing shades of gray and you startstripping prisoners, or you start making prisoners do humiliating things andthen you tell a soldier to draw the line somewhere, then no.A soldier is not going to be able to drawthat line because as soon as you cross that line and as soon as you startstripping prisoners or you start making people do vigorous exercise, or youstart basically putting yourself in a position of authority where you aresubjecting someone else to harsh treatment, things are going to get out of handbecause everyone is going to draw the line at a different place. Just like thediscussion between me and the other officer, where's the line? What isacceptable and what is not acceptable?People don't know.The West Pointofficers knew the line coming out of West Point.We knew where the Geneva Conventions drew theline, but then you get that confusion when the Sec Def [Secretary of Defense]and the President make that statement.And we were confused.[In Iraq,my understanding of how we should treat prisoners] didn't change.There are a couple of reasons for that.Pre-deployment training was minimal going to Iraq because we deployed on short notice fromWest Point through FortBragg to Iraq.So there might be some disconnect there, butalso none of the unit policies changed.Iraqwas cast as part of the War on Terror, not a separate entity in and of itselfbut a part of a larger war.[I didn't discuss abuse of detainees with my superiors inIraq because] to me, it was obviously part of the system and the reasons hadbeen laid out about why we're not following the Geneva Conventions in respectto the detainees.We did follow them inother aspects and once that was laid out I thought it was pretty clearcut.That was just the way I thought wewere running things.Another officer approached me and was like "I'm not surethis is the way you should be treating someone."It was almost like an off-hand, kind oflikejust a conversation like making a comment.He said something like "I don't know if this is right" and my responsewas "Hey, it's out in the open and we've said that we are doing this.It's not like we're doing it on the sly."If I as an officer think we're not even following theGeneva Conventions, there's something wrong. If officers witness all thesethings happening, and don't take action, there's something wrong. If anotherWest Pointer tells me he thinks, "Well, hitting somebody might be okay,"there's something wrong.What I'm saying is had I thought we were following theGeneva Conventions as an officer I would have investigated what was clearly avery suspicious situation.On the Implications of the Abu Ghraib AbuseRevelations in April 2004Someone mentioned to me in passing that there was areally bad prisoner abuse scandal and I took note of it and I thought, "that ishorrible. That is going to be bad PR [public relations] for the Army" and Ithought, "Okay, rogues did something."And then as the week progressed I watched on the news and they showedsome of the pictures -- not all of them -- a large portion of the pictures werein accordance with what I perceived as U.S. policy.Now all the stuff with sodomy with the chemlight and all that was clearly beyond what I would have allowed to happen on apersonal moral level and what I thought policy was.But the other stuff, guys handcuffed naked tocells in uncomfortable positions, guys placed in stress positions on boxes,people stripped naked.All that wasif Iwould have seen it, I would have thought it was in accordance withinterrogation procedures.I listened to the congressional hearings and when theSecretary of Defense testified that we followed the spirit of the GenevaConventions in Afghanistanand the letter of the Geneva Conventions in Iraqthat went against everything that I [understood about US policy].That's when I had a problem.The first concern when this originally happened wasloyalty to the Constitution and separation of powers, and combined with that isthe honor code: "I will not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do." Thefact that it was systematic, and that the chain of command knew about it was soobvious to me that [until that point] I didn't even consider the fact thatother factors might be at play, so that's why I approached my chain of commandabout it right off the bat and said, "Hey, we're lying right now. We need to becompletely honest."Congress should have oversight of treatment of prisoners.That is the way; the Army should not take it upon itself to determine what isacceptable for Americato do in regards to treatment of prisoners. That's a value that's more thanjust a military decision, that's a values decision, and therefore Congressneeds to know about it, and therefore the American people need to have anhonest representation of what's going on presented to them so that they canhave a say in that.On Failure of the Officer CorpsIt's unjust to hold only lower-ranking soldiersaccountable for something that is so clearly, at a minimum, an officer corpsproblem, and probably a combination with the executive branch of government.It's almost infuriating to me.It is infuriating to me that officers are notlined up to accept responsibility for what happened. It blows my mind thatofficers are not.It should've startedwith the chain of command at Abu Ghraib and anybody else that witnessedanything that violated the Geneva Conventions or anything that could bequestionable should've been standing up saying, "This is what happened. This iswhy I allowed it to happen. This is my responsibility," for the reasons Imentioned before. That's basic officership, that's what you learn at West Point, that's what you should learn at anycommissioning source.That's basic Army leadership. If you fail to enforcesomething, that's the new standard. So I guess what I'm getting at is the Armyofficers have overarching responsibility for this. Not privates, not theSergeant Jones, not Sergeant Smith. The Army officer corps has responsibilityfor this. And it boggles my mind that there aren't officers standing up saying,"That's my fault and here's why." That's basic army leadership.Look, the guys who did this aren't dishonorable men.It's not like they are a bunch ofvagabonds.They shown more courage anddone more things in the time that I've spent with them than I could cover inprobably a week of talking to you.Theyare just amazing men, but they're human. If you put them in a situation, whichis the officer's responsibility, where they are put in charge of somebody whotried to kill them or maybe killed their friend, bad things are going tohappen.It's the officer's job to makesure bad things don't happen.[Another important] thing is making sure this doesn'thappen again.[We need] to address thefact that it was an officer issue and by trying to claim that it was "rogueelements" we seriously hinder our ability to ensure this doesn't happen again.And, that has not only moral consequences, but it has practical consequences inour ability to wage the War on Terror. We're mounting a counter-insurgencycampaign, and if we have widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions, thatseriously undermines our ability to win the hearts and minds of the Muslimworld.[I]f Americaholds something as the moral standard, it should be unacceptable for us as apeople to change that moral standard based on fear. The measure of a person ora people's character is not what they do when everything is comfortable. It'swhat they do in an extremely trying and difficult situation, and if we want toclaim that these are our ideals and our values then we need to hold to them nomatter how dark the situation.On the Role of "OGA"In Afghanistanwe were attached to Special Forces and saw OGA.We never interacted with them but they would stress guys.We learned how to do it.We saw it when we would guard aninterrogation.They [OGA interrogators in Afghanistan] had a horn.In this case they would involve U.S.soldiers.There was a really loud hornand any time the detainee would fall asleep they would blare the horn in hisear so that he had to wake up and they would do that until he stood up againand stayed awake.[A]t FOB Tiger [near the Syrian border]there were a lot of high value targets and there was a Special Forces [SF]team nearby and I was going to talk to them just about career stuff and as Iwas going out I saw someone who I thought was OGA go into the prisonerdetainee holding facility and take one of the detainees out.And then they took infantry guards and theywent into an unoccupied building that they could seal off, closed the door, andthey gave orders to the infantry guards not to let anyone in.The reason I know this is because I wastrying to talk to the SF guys and I asked them "Hey, do you know where the SFguys are?" and they were like "Well, maybe some of them are in here but youcan't go in there right now. They are with a prisoner."And there were noises coming out ofthere.There could have been physicalviolence but [they were at least] threatening the prisoner, doing things thatweren't actually causing bodily harm but threatening to do that.I talked to an MP who said that he was in charge ofholding detainees and that the CIA would just come and take the detaineesaway.They would be like, "How manydetainees do you have?" and he knew he has seventeen detainees but the OGAwould be like, "No, you have sixteen," so he'd be like "Alright. I havesixteen."And who knows where thatdetainee went.V. ConclusionThe abuses alleged in this report can be traced to the Bushadministration's decision to disregard the Geneva Conventions in the armedconflict in Afghanistan.On February 7, 2002, President George W. Bush announced thatthe Geneva Conventions concerning the treatment of prisoners did not apply atall to al-Qaeda members or to Taliban soldiers because they did not qualify asmembers of the armed forces.He insistedthat detainees would nonetheless be treated "humanely."Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld toldjournalists that day:"The reality isthe set of facts that exist today with the al-Qaeda and the Taliban were notnecessarily the set of facts that were considered when the Geneva Conventionswas fashioned."The accounts presented in this report are further evidencethat this decision by the Bush administration was to have a profound influenceon the treatment of detained persons in military operations in Iraqas well as in the "global war on terror."In short, the refusal to apply the Geneva Conventions to GuantnamoBayand Afghanistan was toundermine long-standing adherence by the U.S. armed forces to federal lawand the laws of armed conflict concerning the proper treatment of prisoners.Public statements by the Bush administration prior to theFebruary 2002 decision set the tone for effectively rejecting the GenevaConventions.After the first detaineesarrived at Guantnamo in January 2002, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld declared themall to be unlawful combatants who "do not have any rights" under the GenevaConventions.He said that the United Stateswould "for the most part, treat them in a manner that is reasonably consistentwith the Geneva Conventions, to the extent they are appropriate."Later that month, then White House counselAlberto Gonzales wrote President Bush that the Geneva Conventions provisions onquestioning enemy prisoners were "obsolete" and argued, among other things,that rejecting the applicability of the Geneva Conventions "[s]ubstantiallyreduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution" of U.S. officials for warcrimes.Then Secretary of State Colin Powell and senior military leaders privatelyobjected to the administration's position.Secretary Powell argued that declaring the conventions inapplicablewould "reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice insupporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the law ofwar for our troops, both in this specific conflict and in general."The administration's policy opened the door for thesince-discredited legal theories put forward by the Justice Department in theinfamous "torture memo" of August 2002.This memo provided contorted rationalizations for the use of clearlyunlawful interrogation methods.Theconclusions of these memos were opposed, without success, by senior members ofthe Judge Advocate General's office in all four services.Air Force Major General Jack Reves wrote in arecently released memo from 2003: "[T]he use of the more extreme interrogationtechniques simply is not how the U.S. armed forces have operated inrecent history. We have taken the legal and moral 'high-road' in the conduct ofour military operations regardless of how others may operate. Our forces aretrained in this legal and moral mindset beginning the day they enter activeduty."And Army Major General Thomas Romig wrote that the JusticeDepartment's view on the laws of war "runs contrary to the historic positiontaken by the United States Government concerning such laws and, in our opinion,could adversely impact [Pentagon] interests worldwide [including by] puttingour service personnel at far greater risk and vitiating many of thePOW/detainee safeguards the U.S. has worked hard to establish over the pastfive decades."According to the 2004 Schlesinger Commission report,coercive interrogation methods approved by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld for useon prisoners at Guantnamo - including the use of guard dogs to induce fear inprisoners, stress techniques such as forced standing and shackling in painfulpositions, and removing their clothes for long periods - "migrated toAfghanistan and Iraq, where they were neither limited nor safeguarded," andcontributed to the widespread and systematic torture and abuse at U.S.detention centers there.Even after the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraqbecame public, Secretary Rumsfeld continued to dismiss the applicability of theGeneva Conventions. On May 5, 2004, he told a journalist the Geneva Conventions"did not apply precisely" in Iraqbut were "basic rules" for handling prisoners. Visiting Abu Ghraib on May 14,Rumsfeld remarked, "Genevadoesn't say what you do when you get up in the morning." In fact, the U.S.armed forces have devoted considerable energy over the years to making theGeneva Conventions fully operational by military personnel in the field.Various U.S.military operational handbooks and manuals, such as Field Manual 27-10 on theLaw of Land Warfare and Field Manual 34-52 on Intelligence Interrogation,provide the means for implementing Geneva Conventions provisions, even wherethose provisions are vague.Effectively throwing out military manuals based on the lawsof armed conflict was a prescription for the abuse that followed.Field Manual 34-52 for instance, does notmerely restate the requirements of the Geneva Conventions, but it providesuseful advice for soldiers to apply the standards in practice.For instance, the manual states:"Experience indicates that the use of forceis not necessary to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation.Therefore, the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results,may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to saywhatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear."Torture and other cruel and inhumane treatment alleged inthis report do not fall into the "gray areas" in the law.Common article 3 to the four GenevaConventions of 1949, which is accepted as the minimal standard of treatment forpersons in custody during any armed conflict, prohibits "at any time and in anyplace whatsoever,violence to life and person, in particular murder of allkinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, [and] outrages upon personaldignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment."Further protections can be found in thefundamental guarantees under article 75 of the Protocol I of 1977 to the GenevaConventions, which is accepted as reflecting customary laws of armed conflict.Even if the Geneva Conventions were not applicable, variousprovisions of the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice subjects soldiers tocourt-martial or disciplinary measures for mistreating prisoners.Applicable UCMJ criminal provisions includearticle 93 (cruelty and maltreatment), article 128 (assault), and articles 118and 119 (murder and manslaughter), as well as article 120 (rape and carnalknowledge), article 124 (maiming), and, for officers, article 133 (conductunbecoming an officer).Superiorofficers who order the mistreatment of prisoners or who knew or should haveknown that such mistreatment was occurring and did not take appropriatemeasures can be prosecuted as a matter of command responsibility.The treatment of prisoners alleged here also violates U.S.obligations under international human rights law.The Convention against Torture and OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that "[n]oexceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat orwar, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may beinvoked as a justification of torture." The International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, which also bans torture and other mistreatment, ensures thatthe right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degradingtreatment can never be suspended by a state, including during periods of publicemergency.These standards have largely been incorporated into U.S. law thatis applicable to members of the armed services.The War Crimes Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C.2441) makes it a criminaloffense for U.S. militarypersonnel and U.S.nationals to commit war crimes as specified in the Geneva Conventions. Thefederal anti-torture statute (18 U.S.C.2340A), enacted in 1994, provides forthe prosecution of a U.S. national or anyone present in the United States who,while outside the United States, commits or attempts to commit torture.Human Rights Watch calls for investigations into allallegations of mistreatment of prisoners in U.S. custody.Appropriate disciplinary or criminal actionshould be undertaken against all those implicated in torture and other abuse,whatever their rank.As we have reportedelsewhere, there is increasing evidence that high-ranking U.S. civilianand military leaders made decisions and issued policies that facilitatedserious and widespread violations of the law. The circumstances stronglysuggest that they either knew or should have known that such violations tookplace as a result of their actions. There is also mounting information that,when presented with evidence that abuse was in fact occurring, they failed toact to stop it.Human Rights Watch reiterates its call for the appointmentofa special counsel to investigate anyU.S. officials - no matter their rank or position - who participated in,ordered, or had command responsibility for war crimes or torture, or otherprohibited ill-treatment against detainees in U.S. custody.[1]"Person Under Control" or PUC (pronounced"puck") is the term used by U.S.military forces to refer to Iraqi detainees.[2]FOB Mercury is located approximately 10 miles east of Fallujah, a center of theinsurgency at the time.U.S.forces came under intense attacks in and around Fallujah, placing them underconstant pressure and at high risk in daily combat.Assoon as the 82nd pulled out of FOB Mercury in April 2004, the U.S.Marines that replaced the 82nd undertook a major offensive against insurgentsin Fallujah.[3]See Human Rights Watch, "Getting Away with Torture?: CommandResponsibility for the U.S. Abuse of Detainees," A Human Rights Watch Report, April 2005, Section II (A World ofAbuse), available at: hrw.org/reports/2005/us0405/4.htm#_Toc101408092.See also, International Committee of the Red Cross, "Report on the Treatment by the CoalitionForces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons, February 2004,available at: http://www.health-now.org/mediafiles/mediafile50.pdf (describingdetainee abuse in locations across Iraq, including sites in Baghdad, Al-Khaim,Tikrit, Ramadi, and at Abu Ghraib, at p 7); Douglas Jehl and Eric Schmitt, "TheConflict in Iraq: Detainees; U.S. Military Says 26 Inmate Deaths May BeHomicide," The New York Times, March 16, 2005 (describing cases ofdetainee homicide occurring in areas across Afghanistan and Iraq).On Afghanistan-related abuses, see HumanRights Watch, "Enduring Freedom: Abuses by U.S. Forces in Afghanistan," AHuman Rights Watch Report, March 2004, available at hrw.org/reports/2004/afghanistan0304/;Human Rights Watch to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, open letter,December 13, 2004, available at: www.hrw.org/english/docs/2004/12/10/afghan9838.htm.On Iraq-related abuses, see MajorGeneral Antonio M.
