In recent years,Turkish authorities have prosecuted hundreds of activists for participating insuch protests.In the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2011, police stoppedand searched more than half a million people—including railwayenthusiasts, children, and photographers—without reasonable suspicion ofwrongdoing. Most of those searched were ethnic minorities. None was foundguilty of a terrorism-related offense.In Ethiopia, a federal court in January 2012 convicted threelocal journalists and two political opposition members of conspiracy to committerrorist acts and participation in a terrorist organization. The evidenceconsisted primarily of online articles critical of the government and telephonediscussions regarding peaceful protest actions. The authorities denied all fivedefendants access to counsel during three months in pretrial detention andfailed to investigate allegations that two of the journalists had beentortured.These actions violated well-established rights underinternational law to due process, free expression, or privacy. Yet in all threecountries, authorities carried out the searches, arrests, and prosecutionsusing domestic counterterrorism legislation passed in the wake of the September11, 2001 attacks on the United States.More than 140 governments have passed counterterrorismlegislation since September 11. Indeed, many countries have passed multiplecounterterrorism laws or revised old legislation, expanding their legal arsenalover time. The impetus for the lawmaking has varied: in some cases it has beenmajor attacks targeting the country; in many others, it has been a response toUnited Nations Security Council resolutions or pressure from countries such asthe United States that suffered or feared attacks.Mass attacks on the general population have caused immenseharm. The September 11 attacks killed close to 3,000 people. In Pakistan alone, more than 10 times that number have been killed in bombings and otherattacks on civilians in the decade since. As the UN Security Council noted inits preamble to Resolution 1456 in 2003, “any acts of terrorism arecriminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, whenever and bywhomsoever committed and are to be unequivocally condemned, especially whenthey indiscriminately target or injure civilians.”In keeping withtheir duty to ensure respect for the right to life, states have aresponsibility to protect all individuals within their jurisdiction from suchattacks.Yet these post-September 11 laws, when viewed as a whole,represent a broad and dangerous expansion of government powers to investigate,arrest, detain, and prosecute individuals at the expense of due process,judicial oversight, and public transparency.Such laws merit closeattention, not only because many of them restrict or violate the rights ofsuspects, but also because they can be and have been used to stifle peacefulpolitical dissent or to target particular religious, ethnic, or socialgroups.Of particular concern is the tendency of these laws to covera wide range of conduct far beyond what is generally understood as terrorist. Moreoften than not, the laws define terrorism using broad and open-ended language.While governments have publicly defended the exceptional powers available topolice and other state authorities under these laws by referencing the threatof terrorism, some of the conduct they cover may have little connection to suchpotential attacks.Many of the counterterrorism laws also contain changes toprocedural rules—which are designed to ensure that the justice systemprovides due process—that jeopardize basic human rights and fair trialguarantees. Some changes enhance the ability of law enforcement officials toact without the authorization of a judge or any other external authority.Others grant authorizing power to prosecutors, or other members of theexecutive branch, who may have a particular stake in the outcome of policeinvestigations. These procedural changes not only increase the likelihood ofrights violations, including torture and ill-treatment, but also decrease thelikelihood that those responsible will be discovered and punished.At least 51 countries had counterterrorism laws prior to theSeptember 11 attacks. In the ensuring 11 years, Human Rights Watch has found, morethan 140 countries enacted or revised one or more counterterrorism laws, 130 ofwhich we examined for this report.[1]In the Name of Security offers a detailed breakdownof eight elements common to most post–September 11 counterterrorism lawsthat raise human rights concerns, as well as a discussion of where such lawsdiverge. The eight elements are:definitionsof terrorism and terrorist acts;designationsof terrorist organizations and banning membership in them;restrictionson funding and other material support to terrorism and terrorist organizations;limitationson expression or assembly that ostensibly encourage, incite, justify, or lendsupport to terrorism;expansionsof police powers that undermine basic rights, including powers to conductwarrantless arrests, searches, surveillance, and property seizures, and todetain suspects incommunicado and without charge; as well as restrictions onchallenging wrongful detention or seeking accountability for police abuses;creationof special courts and modifications of trial procedures (including evidentiaryrules) to favor the prosecution by limiting defendants’ due processrights;impositionof the death penalty for terrorism-related offenses; andcreationof administrative detention and “control order” mechanisms.While this list covers most of the elements of greatestconcern from a human rights perspective, it is not comprehensive;counterterrorism laws also commonly address immigrationrestrictions—addressed only briefly in this report—as well asmoney-laundering, bank secrecy, and other issues.Moreover, the overly broad legislation documented in thisreport represents only one aspect of abuses committed in the name ofcounterterrorism. Many countries commit human rights violations againstterrorism suspects—such as torture, ill-treatment, and enforceddisappearance—without making any effort to legitimize them through law.In other cases, states insist that emergency or other special powers, oftenissued through executive fiat, apply to terrorist threats.The United States, for example, responded to the September 11 attacks by adopting a war paradigm for what the administration ofPresident George W. Bush called the “war on terror.” Under thismodel, the United States sought to bypass criminal law and human rightssafeguards for alleged terrorists by asserting that it was in a global armedconflict with al Qaeda and affiliated groups; that such laws were inapplicable;and that if any law applied to counterterrorism efforts, it was the laws of warfor capture, detention, and attack. Under the Obama administration, both therhetoric and practice have changed—the illegality of torture isrecognized, as are other human rights protections—yet US counterterrorism actions, such as targeted killings outside of clear war zones, remainbased on this war paradigm.Other countries have longsought to discredit rebel forces by calling them “terrorists.”However, since September 11, several governments have sought to redefinelongstanding armed conflicts as part of the “global war on terror”for internal political purposes or to gain international support. Russia, for example, repackaged the conflict in Chechnya froma separatist conflict to a struggle against international terrorists.Uzbekistandid the same to justifyits conviction of Muslims for religious activities it deemed at variance withstate ideology.There have been positive developments in recent years. As aresult of court challenges or public pressure, some countries have rolled backespecially problematic provisions in their counterterrorism laws or resistedmoves that would strengthen them at the expense of rights.The United Kingdom in 2011 allowed the period in which aterrorism suspect could be detained without charge to revert from 28 days to 14days—the level it had been prior to the London Underground bombings ofJuly 2005. Norway in 2011 rebuffed calls for its definition of terrorismto be broadened following an attack by a xenophobic extremist that killed 77people; the country’s prime minister vowed instead to respond with“more openness, more democracy and more humanity.”But in many cases the reformshave been grossly insufficient. The United Kingdom’s 14-day pre-charge detention period stillexceeds international standards for being promptly informed of any criminalcharges and remains double the one-week maximum that the government permittedprior to 2005. Malaysia’s Security Offences (Special Measures) Bill of2012, which authorities touted as a replacement to the draconian InternalSecurity Act of 1960 that allowed indefinite detention without trial, stillallows pre-charge detention of 28 days.The UN Security Council now directs states to ensure thatcounterterrorism measures comply with international human rights law, but ithas not reformed most terrorism-related mandates that experts—includingthe UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism—consider athreat to fundamental rights. Each year, more countries enact counterterrorismlegislation with sweeping powers and dangerously broad language.The Security Council should ensure that all resolutionsconcerning the obligations of states to combat terrorism comply withinternational human rights law, refugee law, and international humanitarianlaw. The Security Council and other UN bodies should also play a leading rolein helping states to reform existing counterterrorism laws; release all personsarbitrarily arrested under these laws for exercising their rights to freedom ofexpression, association, or assembly; and provide fair retrials to suspectsunfairly prosecuted under such laws.Such measures are necessary not only to bring states intocompliance with international law; they also help fulfill states’ broaderduty to protect those in their jurisdiction. As the UN Global Counter-TerrorismStrategy of 2006 notes, violations of human rights are among the conditions“conducive to the spread of terrorism,” even though they can neverexcuse or justify terrorist acts.RecommendationsTo National GovernmentsEstablish an expertcommission to review domestic counterterrorism legislation to ensure thatthe definitions of terrorist acts are narrowly crafted, covering onlyconduct that is “genuinely of a terrorist nature,” as set outby the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism.Direct the expertcommission to assess whether existing counterterrorism legislation isconsistent with international human rights standards, with particularattention to whether the laws:empower the police and othersecurity forces at the expense of human rights protections;hinder or prevent the judiciaryfrom safeguarding the rights of detainees;facilitate the use of torture orother ill-treatment;deny basic trial rights;expand reliance on detention without charge;violate rights to basic liberties, such as freedom of expression;orimpose the death penalty.Provide retrials in fair and impartial proceedings to allsuspects who received unfair trials as a result of counterterrorism laws thatfailed to meet international human rights standards.Release all persons who were arbitrarily arrested undercounterterrorism laws for exercising their rights to freedom of expression,association, or peaceful assembly.Provide redress—including financial compensation,rehabilitation, and formal acceptance of state responsibility—to victimsof abusive counterterrorism measures.When drafting counterterrorism legislation or revising existinglegislation, solicit input from a wide range of civil society groups, includinginternational organizations with relevant expertise.ToUnited Nations BodiesTo the Security CouncilEnsure that all resolutions concerning the obligations ofstates to combat terrorism emphasize states’ obligations to complywith international human rights law, refugee law, and humanitarian law.To the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)In assessing states’implementation of their obligations under Security Council resolutions oncounterterrorism, including Resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), givegreater attention to human rights concerns in all communications withstates.To the Counter-Terrorism Committee ExecutiveDirectorate (CTED)Incorporate human rights concerns into all technicalassistance recommendations relating to states’ counterterrorismlegislation.Expand the number of human rights officers on staff, sothat every on-site visit that CTED undertakes includes at least one humanrights officer.To the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the UN Officeon Drugs and Crime (UNODC)[2]Convene an expert group meeting on counterterrorismlegislation, which brings together government officials, UN personnel, andnongovernmental human rights defenders, with the goal of strengthening thecapacity of states to combat terrorism consistent with human rightsstandards.Incorporate human rights concerns into all technicalassistance recommendations relating to states’ counterterrorismlegislation.I. UN Security Council: Unprecedented MandatesFollowing the September 11 attacks, the UN Security Council passedseveral resolutions pressing—and in some cases mandating—all UNmember states to enact strong counterterrorism legislation. The result was aflood of new and revised laws that granted special law-enforcement and otherprosecutorial powers to the police and other authorities, while broadening thescope and increasing the penalties for alleged terrorist activities.These laws continued a historical pattern in whichgovernments have responded to politically motivated acts ofviolence—assassinations, bombings, and armed attacks—onhigh-profile targets by expanding existing laws and granting security forcesspecial powers.In the months followinganarchist August Vaillant’s bombing of the French National Assembly in1893, for example, the French Third Republic enacted measures that became knownas the lois scélérates (“villainous laws”)because of their severe restrictions on free speech.[3]Following the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President AnwarSadat by conservative Islamist army officers, Egypt passed an emergencylaw that created special security courts and gave the military sweeping powersof search and arrest.[4] The lawendured for 31 years, only to be briefly replaced with a similar decree by themilitary-led government when an Islamist candidate was poised to win the 2012presidential elections.[5]Many laws granting extraordinary powers are coloniallegacies or responses to nationalist or other insurgent movements. Malaysia’s Internal Security Act of 1960, which until its repeal in 2012 allowedindefinite preventive detention of alleged terrorists and other nationalsecurity suspects, was inspired by the Emergency Regulations Ordnance 1948 thatthe British used against Communist insurgents in pre-independence Malaya.[6] Special powers introduced by the British in Northern Ireland in 1922 wererenewed in various forms throughout and beyond the “Troubles” untilthey were replaced by UK-wide counterterrorism laws in 2000.[7]But the number of counterterrorism laws passed largely inresponse to the Security Council’s post-September 11 resolutions wasunprecedented.[8] Morethan 140 countries have enacted or revised one or more counterterrorism laws,according to Human Rights Watch’s accounting—many of which violateor undermine fundamental liberties such as freedoms of expression, association,and religion, or deprive suspects of due process or the right to a fair trial.[9]The Security Council called on member states “toredouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts,” as partof their obligations to maintain international peace and security.[10] In some resolutions, the call was mandatory.[11] Yet the Security Council gaveinsufficient attention to ensuring that governments’ counterterrorismresponses were in keeping with international human rights standards.[12]Only gradually did its resolutions emphasize the need to protect civilliberties and due process from abusive counterterrorism legislation andpolicies.Acts of terrorism are an indefensible attack on the right tolife. As the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 2006 notes, states have aresponsibility to protect all individuals within their jurisdiction from suchattacks.[13] Thisresponsibility stems from the primary duty of states to ensure respect for theright to life.[14]However, even in the context of countering terrorism, statesmust meet their obligations under international human rights and humanitarianlaw. This, too, is noted in the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, whichstates that, “The promotion and protection of human rights for all andthe rule of law is essential to all components of the Strategy, recognizingthat effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rightsare not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing.”[15]A number of UN Security Council resolutions passed in thewake of September 11 have failed to adequately reinforce that standard.Security Council Resolution 1373, sponsored by the UnitedStates and adopted 17 days after the September 11 attacks, has been thecenterpiece of the council’s approach to counterterrorism.[16] It requires all states to “work together urgently to prevent and suppressterrorist acts,” including by “taking additional measures toprevent and suppress, in their territories through all lawful means, thefinancing and preparation of any acts of terrorism.”[17] Resolution 1373 directs all UN member states to enactcriminal, financial, and administrative measures aimed at individuals and al Qaeda’sentities considered perpetrating orsupporting acts of terrorism.[18] By acting under Chapter VII of the UN charter, the Security Council, at leaston paper, can take action against any member state that fails to comply withthe resolution.[19]The resolution opened the door to abusive domesticlegislation largely by what it did not say; it makes no reference to memberstates’ obligations to respect international human rights law (except inone narrow sense) or international humanitarian law, the laws of war.[20] The resolution provides states broad leeway to create their own definitions.Government officials have frequently cited Resolution 1373 to justify abusivecounterterrorism laws.[21] In 2009UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay said that by serving asa vehicle for “numerous” states to enact provisions that“derogate from binding international human rights instruments,”Resolution 1373 has had “a very serious negative impact on humanrights.”[22]In 2002 the Security Council also expanded its existingblacklist of individuals and entities believed to be associated with theTaliban and al Qaeda into a list with no global or temporal limitations. TheSecurity Council had created the Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions List in 1999through Resolution 1267 in response to al Qaedaattacks the previous year on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It first expanded the list through a separate resolution in 2000and extended it beyond Afghanistan to any location in the world in 2002.Together, the three resolutions require UN member states to subject all thoselisted to asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.[23]Listings on the Security Council’s blacklist haveoften been based on secret information. The resolutions contain no definedlimits on who could be declared targets, the duration of sanctions, or, initially,mechanisms to remove someone from the list.[24] Resolution 1373 further expanded the regime created under Resolution 1267 byrequiring states to freeze assets and entities of those “who commit orattempt to commit terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commissionof terrorist acts,” without requiring that they be linked to the Talibanor al Qaeda.[25]Security Council Resolution 1624 of 2005 calls on UN memberstates to pass laws that prevent and prohibit incitement to commit acts ofterrorism and to deny safe haven to persons against whom there is“credible and relevant information” that implicates them in suchconduct.[26]Since 2003 Security Council resolutions have graduallydirected states to ensure that counterterrorism measures comply with internationalhuman rights law.[27] Amongthe most important of these is Resolution 1456 of 2003, which calls on statesto “ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism comply with alltheir obligations under international law ... in particular international humanrights, refugee, and humanitarian law.”[28] In 2005 the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee, established by the Security Councilto monitor compliance with Resolution 1373, appointed a human rights advisor toits executive directorate.[29] (However, the advisor was not allowed to advise the Counter-Terrorism Committeeuntil 2006.[30]) In2010 the Security Council encouraged the committee’s executivedirectorate to further incorporate human rights into its work.[31] The Security Council also supported a statement by the UN General Assembly thatrespect for human rights and the rule of law are the “fundamental basisof the fight against terrorism” and that violations of human rights canbe “conducive to the spread of terrorism.”[32]In response to mounting criticism and legal challenges, theSecurity Council has also started to reform the Al Qaeda and Taliban SanctionsList.[33] InDecember 2009, for example, it passed a resolution creating an ombudsman tomediate requests from individuals, organizations, and companies to be delistedand mandated swift processing of their applications. However, the ombudsmandoes not have the authority even to make recommendations to the listingcommittee, a body consisting of state representatives that reaches decisionsconfidentially.[34] In 2011the Security Council split the sanctions list into two, one for al Qaeda andone for the Taliban, and modified the regimens for each.[35]These reforms still fall short. As Martin Scheinin, thethen-UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, said in hisfinal report to the UN General Assembly in August 2010, the counterterrorismregime created by the Security Council in some cases “continues to poserisks to the protection of a number of international human rights standards.”[36] He later noted that the procedures for terrorist listing and delisting underthe Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions List by the Security Council’s 1267Committee still did not meet international human rights standards concerningdue process or fair trial.[37]Scheinen’s successor as special rapporteur, BenEmmerson, has expressed similar concern about continuing violations of humanrights and fundamental freedoms in the context of countering terrorism, as hasthe UN Human Rights Council.[38]II. Definitions of Terrorism and Terrorist ActsDozens of the counterterrorism laws passed since 2001include broadly worded definitions of terrorism and terrorist acts. While thereis no single definition of terrorism under international law,[39] definitions put forward in various international treaties typically center onthe use of violence for political ends.[40] Inpractice, the new counterterrorism laws vary widely from country to country andfrequently cover acts unrelated to violence.The most common and frequently the most serious problem inlegal definitions of terrorism under national laws is that they are overbroadand vague. As a basic legal principle, such laws fail to give reasonable noticeof what actions are covered. Many are so broad that they cover common crimesthat should not reasonably be deemed terrorist or acts that should not beconsidered crimes at all. Their scope leaves them susceptible to arbitrary anddiscriminatory enforcement by the authorities—often against religious orethnic communities, political parties, or other particular groups.[41] In Australia, for example, community lawyers and civil society groups havereported the disproportionate use of counterterrorism measures against Muslim,Kurdish, Tamil, and Somali communities.[42]The vagueness of many counterterrorism laws is often foundin their reliance on terms such as “public order” and “publicsafety.” While such terms are consistent with international law ifnarrowly and precisely defined, they are dangerous if left open-ended: theylend themselves to extremely broad interpretations that can be and have beenused to quash legitimate activities and speech under the guise of counteringterrorism. Rarely do counterterrorism laws provide clear and precisedefinitions of these terms.Human Rights Watch found more than 130 counterterrorism lawsthat included one or more vague terms such as “public order”without properly defining them. More than half those laws included at least twoambiguous definitions, and five failed to identify what constituted a terroristact at all.To a large extent,counterterrorism laws cover acts that are already illegal under existingdomestic criminal law, such as murder, assault, and kidnapping. They do notgenerally impose criminal penalties on what was previously considered lawfulconduct; rather, they more often establish special procedures for investigatingand prosecuting crimes that fall within terrorism acts and impose enhancedpunishments on the perpetrators of these crimes.Legal definitions of terrorism generally specify two orthree basic elements: the act and purpose, or the act, intent, and purpose. Thecrime of terrorism is typically characterized as an act carried out with aparticular intent—for example, the intent to kill—and for aspecific purpose, such as coercing or intimidating a government or populationinto performing or abstaining from an action.Most counterterrorism lawsmake reference to one or more of the following four general categories of harm:1) serious physical harm to a person or persons—in other words killing orinjuring one or more people, or damaging public health more broadly; 2) seriousproperty damage, particularly damage that is likely to cause serious harm topeople; 3) harm to vital infrastructure, such as power, food, or watersupplies; medical services; or monetary and electronic systems; and, mostbroadly, 4) harm to national security, defense, or “public order.”The major legal innovation is the element of terroristpurpose or motivation: the requirement that, for example, the acts be carriedout in order to influence or coerce the government or to intimidate, panic, orterrorize the public or a section of the public.This is also the area in which various countries’ lawsdiffer most significantly, with some requiring that the purpose be to terrifyor intimidate the population; others specifying that the action must beintended to advance a political, religious, or ideological cause; and othersbroadly covering any threat to national unity, harmony, or public order.The UN special rapporteur on human rights andcounterterrorism addressed the issue of defining conduct that is “genuinelyof a terrorist nature.” In his view, the concept of terrorism includesonly those acts or attempted acts “intended to cause death or seriousbodily injury” or “lethal or serious physical violence”against one or more members of the population, or that constitute “theintentional taking of hostages” for the purpose of “provoking astate of terror in the general public or a segment of it” or “compellinga Government or international organization to do or abstain from doingsomething.”[43]Similarly, the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panelon Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that for a violent act to be deemedterrorist, its purpose must be “to intimidate a population, or to compela Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doingany act.”[44]Few terrorism definitions are so narrowly drawn. In general,definitions of terrorism tend to cover acts carried out for a wide variety ofpurposes, often with no requirement that they cause or intend to cause death orserious injury, and without specifying the level of physical property damagerequired to render an act terrorist. Criminalizing acts that merely aim to“influence the government” as terrorism, for example, could easilybe used to prosecute journalists for reporting on corrupt state practices orthe activities of rebel groups. Labeling a labor strike or a politicaldemonstration as terrorist can be a means to suppress legitimate protest.Saudi Arabia’s draft Penal Law for Crimes ofTerrorism of 2011 includes among terrorist crimes actions that“insult the reputation of the state,” “disturb publicorder,” or “inflict damage upon one of its public utilities orits natural sources.”[45] The law also criminalizes “describing the king—or the crownprince—as an unbeliever, doubting his integrity [or] defaming hishonesty.”[46]Azerbaijan’s 1999 Law on Combating Terrorism holdsthat terrorist acts must have as their aim “undermining publicsecurity, spreading panic among the population or forcing Stateauthorities or international organizations to take decisions that complywith the demands of terrorists.”[47]The first phrase—“undermining public security”—isso vague and overbroad that it could be applied to a wide range ofotherwise lawful activities.Australia’s overly broad definition of“terrorist act” does not require an element of intention tocause death or serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages.”[48]Under the Syrian Penal Code, terrorism is broadly definedas “all acts intended to create a state of fear which are committedby means such as explosives, military weapons, inflammable materials,poisonous or burning products or epidemic or microbial agents likely tocause public danger.”[49]Tunisia’s 2003 counterterrorism and money launderinglaw states that a terrorist offense is “any offense, regardless ofits motive, connected to an individual or collective enterprise aiming atterrorizing one person or a group of people and spreading fear among thepopulation, for the purpose of, among other things, influencing statepolicies and compelling it to act in a particular way or preventing itfrom so acting; or disturbing public order or international peace andsecurity, or attacking people or facilities, damaging buildings housingdiplomatic missions, prejudicing the environment, so as to endanger thelife of its inhabitants, their health or jeopardizing vital resources,infrastructures, means of transport and communications, computer systemsor public services.”[50] Under that definition, a demonstration by truck drivers that blocks amajor highway overpass could be classified as a terrorist act.A 2008 amendment to the UK’s counterterrorism lawrefers to the goal of advancing a “political, religious, racial orideological cause.”[51]Zimbabwe’s Suppression of Foreign and InternationalTerrorism Act of 2011 includes in its intent requirement the vague andpotentially broad phrase “usurping the functions” of thegovernment.[52]Given the vagueness and breadth of the “purpose”requirements of many counterterrorism laws—and the potentially widevariety of actions they cover—prosecutors in many countries have enormouslatitude in deciding which offenses to prosecute as terrorist. In many cases,they have used these laws to prosecute regular criminal offenses.In dozens of countries, acts of political dissent thatresult in property damage, such as demonstrations, may be prosecuted asterrorism where the element of terrorist intent is broadly defined (forexample, to “disrupt the public order” or “endanger publicsafety”) and where crimes resulting in property damage or damage toinfrastructure are covered:Ethiopia’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009 containsan overly broad definition of “terrorist acts” that could beused to prosecute a wide range of conduct far beyond the limits of what canreasonably be considered terrorist activity. Besides violent acts andkidnapping, an act that “causes serious damage to property” or“disruption or interference of a public service” may be deemedterrorist under the law if carried out for a specified purpose. Thisdefinition is so broad that a nonviolent political protest that disruptstraffic might be labeled a “terrorist act,” and even those whomerely express support for a peaceful political protest could be deemedterrorists.[53]El Salvador’s Special Law against Acts of Terrorismof 2006 does not even include an explicit definition of terrorism.[54] The closest it comes is in article 1, which provides that the purpose ofthe law is to prevent and punish crimes that “by their form of execution,or means and methods employed, show the intention to provoke a state ofalarm, fear or terror in the population, by putting in imminent danger oraffecting people’s life or physical or mental integrity, or theirvaluable material goods, or the democratic system or security of theState, or international peace.”[55] In 2007 Salvadoran authorities used the law to prosecute 13 politicalprotesters for rallying against a national water decentralization plan. Thedefendants had allegedly blocked public roads and thrown rocks at police.[56] Following an international uproar, a special counterterrorism courtdropped the charges in February 2008 at the request of El Salvador’sattorney general.[57]Bahrain: Protesters Prosecuted as “Terrorists”Bahrain’s overly expansive definition of terrorism inits Law with Respect to Protection of the Community against Terrorist Acts of2006 includes actions whose aim is “disrupting the publicorder,”“threatening the Kingdom’s safety andsecurity,” or “damaging national unity.”[58]The terms “disrupt” and“threaten” exceed the required purpose as defined by the UNspecial rapporteur on counterterrorism and the UN High Panel, which statethat the intent must be to “intimidate” a population or “compel”a government or organization.[59]Bahrain’s definition includes the act ofintimidation, which exceeds UN guidance by encompassing acts that do notcause or are not intended to cause death or serious harm.[60]Bahrainhas used such overly broad definitions ofterrorism to detain scores of protesters and to convict several oppositionleaders, including many involved in the country’s pro-democracydemonstrations in 2011. Several defendants have made credible allegations oftorture and other ill-treatment during their detention and Human Rights Watchhas documented additional procedural and substantive violations of dueprocess.[61]A special military court inJune 2011 convicted 21 opposition leaders—seven in absentia—fornational security crimes including acts of “terrorism,” such asmaking speeches critical of Bahrain’s human rights record and calling for andparticipating in street protests four months earlier at which calls were madefor the establishment of a republic. The court sentenced eight defendants tolife in prison and the rest to terms of up to 15 years, based in part on thesentencing provisions of the 2006 counterterrorism law. A civilian appealscourt was re-trying the defendants at this writing; the Bahraini authoritieshad rejected calls from human rights organizations, including Human RightsWatch, to release the 14 accused who were detained in Bahrain pending thetrial’s outcome.[62]Eleven of the defendants were among 25 protesters andother activists who were tried in 2010—two in absentia—foroperating a “terror network.” One of them, Abdul-Jalilal-Singace, was a leader in the Haq Group political opposition movement.Authorities arrested him in 2010 upon his return from the UK, where he had criticized the Bahraini government’s human rights record at a public eventin the House of Lords.[63]During that so-called“terror network” trial, several defendants gave credibletestimony of torture and other ill-treatment that included threats;harassment; extended detention in solitary confinement; regular beatings tothe head, chest, and other sensitive areas with fists and kicks; beatings onthe soles of the feet with sticks or hoses; sleep deprivation; forcedstanding; denial of access to the bathroom; and electric shocks. Human RightsWatch secured independent evidence—including photographs and medicalreports by government doctors—that corroborated a number of theseaccounts.[64]Pursuant to article 27 of the counterterrorism law, theauthorities deprived the 23 defendants in their custody of access to counseland relatives and held them in pretrial incommunicado detention for 15 daysbefore presenting them to the public prosecutor.[65] In a number of instances, they barred counsel from attending interrogationsand denied them the opportunity to review investigative materials before thestart of trial.[66]King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa released the defendants inFebruary 2011 in what the Bahraini authorities described as a goodwillgesture, but many were re-arrested in the following weeks during streetprotests.[67]Protecting Peaceful DissentConcern for protecting human rights has been evident in thelegislation of various countries. At least 15 governments have enactedcounterterrorism laws that specifically protect peaceful political dissent suchas protests or advocacy.A few have rebuffed calls for overly broaddefinitions of terrorism or terrorist acts.In Australia, the criminal code specifies that“advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action” cannot bedeemed “terrorist acts” if those activities were not intendedto cause death or serious physical harm, to endanger the life of someoneother than the actor, or,“to create a serious risk to thehealth or safety of the public.”[68]Canada’s criminal code contains an almost identical provision. The United Kingdom lacks such an exemption.[69]Sweden and Norway specify in theircounterterrorism laws that the acts characterized as terrorist mustalready be defined as criminal.[70]Norway also rejected calls for its definition of terrorism to be broadenedfollowing two attacks by an anti-immigrant extremist in July 2011 thatkilled 77 people; the country’s prime minister vowed instead torespond with “more openness, more democracy and morehumanity.”[71]ExemptionsPolitically motivated acts ofviolence targeting other persons are covered under the vast majority ofcounterterrorism laws if they satisfy the purpose requirement. However,underscoring the notion that “one person’s terrorist isanother’s freedom fighter,” a few laws carve out exemptions foracts committed in the service of certain favored political goals:The preamble to Zimbabwe’s counterterrorism act of 2011purports to recognize that “national liberation movements” are notsubject to the law’s provisions, although the law’s operative textdoes not specifically exempt such groups. The preamble states that Zimbabwe“recognises that any act committed during a struggle waged by peoples,including any action during an armed struggle, in the exercise or furtheranceof their legitimate right to national liberation, self-determination andindependence against colonialism, or occupation or aggression or domination byalien or foreign forces ... shall not, for any reason … be considered aterrorist activity.”[72]The preamble to South Africa’s 2004 counterterrorism law states thatinternational law “recognizes acts committed in accordance with suchinternational law during a struggle waged by peoples, including any actionduring an armed struggle, in the exercise or furtherance of their legitimateright to national liberation, self-determination and independence againstcolonialism, or occupation or aggression or domination by alien or foreignforces, as being excluded from terrorist activities.” Unlike Zimbabwe’s counterterrorism law, the operative text ofthe South African law also implements this principle. It specifically exemptsacts “committed during a struggle waged by peoples, including any actionduring an armed struggle, in the exercise or furtherance of their legitimateright to national liberation, self-determination and independence againstcolonialism,” from being deemed terrorist.[73]III.Designating Terrorist Organizations and Criminalizing MembershipMany counterterrorism laws ban organizations deemed to beterrorist and impose a range of financial sanctions on them. They alsofrequently criminalize membership in banned organizations, without reference tothe actions or the intent of the individual members.The European Union and many individual countries duplicateor include in their own “blacklists” the UN SecurityCouncil’s lists of more than 300 individuals or entities allegedly linkedto al Qaeda and another 129 linked to the Taliban.[74] The UN’s Al Qaeda Sanctions List subjects individuals, entities, andgroups on the list to immediate asset freezes and travel bans and outlaws thedirect or indirect sale or supply to them of arms and related material,including technical advice.[75]The UN special rapporteur on human rights andcounter-terrorism concluded in 2011 that the lists, particularly the onerelated to al Qaeda, do not meet international human rights standards for dueprocess or fair trial.[76]International law ensures the right to form associations,and any restrictions placed on that right must be “necessary in ademocratic society for national security or public safety, public order, …the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights andfreedoms of others,” and must be the least restrictive possible.[77] Restrictions on the right to freedom of association may not discriminate on thebasis of religion, race, political opinion, or other prescribed status.[78]As with definitions ofterrorism, states’ legal definitions of terrorist organizations varywidely:In Uzbekistan, amendments to the Code of CriminalProcedure criminalize “the creation of, leadership of, [or]participation in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or otherforbidden organizations,” even though the law contains no definitionof the words “extremism” or “fundamentalism” andoutlaws such activity even where the organization’s activities orideology are non-violent.[79] Article 159 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, one of the provisions mostcommonly used to try alleged terrorism suspects, criminalizes attempts atthe “overthrowing of the constitutional order.”[80] Since the 1990s, the Uzbek authorities have used these provisions toconvict thousands of men from the country’s Muslim majority forideas or activities at variance with state ideology. Following theSeptember 11 attacks, the government intensified the crackdown andjustified it as necessary to fight global terrorism. Primary targets haveincluded imams and their followers and Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamistmovement that seeks implementation of a strict Islamic doctrine and thecreation of an Islamic caliphate in Central Asia.[81]Under the criminal code, organizingan “illegal” religious group (a group that is merely unregistered),or resuming such a group’s activities after it has been deniedregistration or ordered to disband, are criminal offenses punishable by up tofive years in prison. Those who participate in“prohibited”—alleged extremist—groups face imprisonmentfor up to 20 years.[82] Uzbekcourts have often ignored the distinction between illegal and prohibitedgroups. Prison administrations require religious and political prisoners convictedof terrorism-related offenses to wear special markings indicating theircriminal status.[83] Thousands of individuals convicted under these statutes, amid credible reportsof confessions procured through the use of torture, remain in prison inUzbekistan.[84]Zimbabwe’s Suppression of Foreign and InternationalTerrorism Act of 2011 defines foreign or international terrorist organizations asgroups formed with a view to “overthrowing or taking over the government… by unlawful means or usurping the functions of such government,”“conducting a campaign or assisting any campaign” to achieve suchgoals, or “engaging in foreign or international terroristactivity.”[85]Amendmentsto Canada ’sCriminal Code in 2001 define a “terrorist group” as“an entity that has as one of its purposes or activities facilitating orcarrying out any terrorist activity.” The code also defines terroristgroups as those already listed by executive decree as having “knowinglycarried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terroristactivity,” as well as those that have “knowingly acted on behalfof, at the direction of or in association with an entity that has knowinglycarried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terroristactivity.” This broader, executive-decree definition does not requireterrorism to be the group’s purpose.[86]The EU’s common definition of terrorism of 2002 covers“a structured group of more than two persons, established over a periodof time and acting in concert to commit terrorist offences.”[87]Australia’s criminal code gives the governor general broadpowers to outlaw organizations as “terrorist” on the basis that,among other actions, they “advocate” in favor of a terroristact—without any need for the organization to be actively involved in aterrorist act.[88] As theHuman Rights Law Centre of Australia noted in 2011, the broad definition of“advocate,” which includes praising a terrorist act or indirectlyurging the doing of a terrorist act, may “unjustifiably infringe”on the rights to freedom of expression and association. This criminalization ofassociation could implicate members of proscribed organizations who are caughtup in the loosely framed definition but not personally involved in unlawfulactivity.[89]The process by which groups are designated as terrorist alsovaries greatly, although a lack of due process is a common denominator.The designated groups are rarely given an opportunity to challenge theirdesignation, either before or after being designated:In Zimbabwe, the minister of home affairs has the power todesignate organizations as terrorist simply upon “consultation”with the minister of foreign affairs, although the designation may becontested.[90]Uganda’s 2002 Anti-Terrorism Act allows the minister ofinternal affairs to declare an organization “terrorist” withoutchallenge in court and without any substantive requirements.[91]Australia only allows review of the legal process underwhich an organization is proscribed as “terrorist.” There is noreview of the factual merits of the designation.[92] Australian law does not require notification to persons or organizations thatthey are under consideration for proscription.[93]India: Banned GroupsUnder the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967,most recently amended in 2008, India has banned 35 groups, as well asevery person and entity on the UN’s Al Qaeda sanctions list, asterrorist organizations. Proscribed groups range from Lashkar-e-Taiba—the Pakistan-based organization behind the Mumbai attacks that killed 166people in 2008—to the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), astudent organization that claims it seeks the “liberation ofIndia” from Western influences but does not publicly advocate violence.[94]India’s Home Ministry can designate a group to be a“terrorist organization,” “terrorist gang,” or“unlawful association” with immediate effect. Where a group isdeclared an “unlawful association,” the government has up to sixmonths to establish the basis for this declaration before a speciallyconstituted tribunal composed of a high court justice nominated by the centralgovernment.The government must show only on the balance ofprobabilities—not beyond a reasonable doubt—that it hassufficient cause for declaring the associational unlawful. It can withholdevidence from the proscribed association, but not the tribunal, on thegrounds that the public interest requires non-disclosure.However, even the limited review procedures available to“unlawful” groups are not available to groups declared to be“terrorist” organizations or gangs. A group declared to be a terroristorganization or gang can apply to the central government and, if theapplication is rejected, to a review committee chaired by a sitting orretired high court justice, to have the declaration revoked. But it cannotintroduce new evidence or present witnesses in support of its application.[95]Membership in an unlawful association or a terroristorganization or gang is punishable by up to two years of imprisonment. In thecase of a terrorist organization or gang that is “involved in” aterrorist act, membership is punishable by up to lifeimprisonment—irrespective of whether the member had any involvement inthe act.[96]Dozens of men in India have been repeatedly roundedup and detained for being members of the banned student organization SIMI,which India designated a terrorist group almost immediately after theSeptember 11 attacks in the United States.[97]In Jaipur, for example, 14 men were detained for more thanthree years as suspects in a 2008 bombing in the city that killed 70 people;the primary evidence against them was their SIMI membership.InDecember 2011 a “fast-track” court acquitted all of them of linksto the blast.[98]In 2008 a special tribunal lifted the ban on SIMI, but thecountry’s chief justice reinstated it the next day at the request ofthe central government.Unsurprisingly, given the malleability of the definitions,the number and type of organizations deemed to be terrorist varies greatly fromcountry to country:Canada has designated 44 organizations worldwide asterrorist, while its ally New Zealand has designated 71—nearly twiceas many.[99]The US State Department’s list of Foreign TerroristOrganizations (FTOs) at this writing listed 51 groups. The majority wereMuslim, followed by Communist and nationalist or separatist groups.[100] The US Treasury Department list of terrorism suspects includes hundredsmore individuals and groups.[101]The EU list of terrorist organizations and individuals,originally created in December 2001, at this writing included 12 individualsand 25 organizations, not all of them associated with al Qaeda or the Taliban.[102] The EU list does not include the hundreds of individuals and groups on memberstates’ lists.In 2008 Swaziland, Africa’s last absolute monarchy,placed the country’s main opposition party, the People’sUnited Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), as well as three other oppositiongroups on a list of terrorist organizations under its Suppression ofTerrorism Act. Swaziland passed the counterterrorism law that year inresponse to an attempted bombing.[103] In 2010 authorities in Swaziland arrested Sipho Jele, a timberindustry worker, for wearing a PUDEMO t-shirt at a Worker’s Dayrally. Three days after his arrest, Jele was found dead in his cell;authorities claimed he hanged himself but they refused to conduct anautopsy.[104]Listings for Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based political andmilitary organization composed primarily of Shia Muslims, underscore theenormous inconsistencies amongcountries’ designations of terrorist groups. Hezbollah is listed asa terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, and Israel, as well as Australia and the UK (both of which ban Hezbollah’s military wing but notits political party). But it is not banned by France—which maintains close ties to Lebanon, itsformer colony—or the EU (in large part at France’sinsistence), Russia, and Arab and Muslim countries.In 2002 China successfully gained US support for its efforts to place the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a separatistorganization founded by Turkic-speaking Uighurs in China’s westernXinjiang province, on the UN list of terrorist organizations. There was nosignificant reported militant activity by ETIM; Chinese authoritiesclaimed that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and culturalmessages in Xinjiang were terrorists who had simply changed tactics.[105]Penalties for MembershipA designation of “terrorist” usually results inauthorities banning the designated group, freezing its assets, and blocking itscommercial activities. Participants in the organization may face criminalprosecution and severe penalties for the mere fact of membership, even withoutevidence that they acted in support of the group’s unlawful activities:In Zimbabwe, a criminal conviction for being a member of adesignated foreign terrorism organization is punishable by five years ofimprisonment, while being a leader or officer of a designated foreign terroristorganization is punishable by 10 years of imprisonment.[106]Bahrain’s 2006 counterterrorism law prescribes a minimumfive-year prison sentence for anyone convicted of joining a terrorist group“while being aware of its terrorist objectives.” Leadership of sucha group—or the creation, establishment, organization, or management ofsuch a group—is punishable by life imprisonment.[107] Bahrain’s counterterrorismlaw also penalizes membership in groups based abroad. The penalty forassociation with foreign-based groups that intend to commit terrorist actsagainst Bahrain or foreign countries carries a minimum five-year sentence; ifthe group actually commits terrorist acts, all associated with it are subjectto life imprisonment.[108]El Salvador’s counterterrorism law provides that those whobelong to a terrorist organization, “with the goal of carrying out any ofthe offenses contemplated in the present Law,” face prison terms of 8 to12 years. The requirement that the defendant’s goal must be to carry outacts of terrorism is not found in most other countries’ laws. Leaders orother higher-ranking members of terrorist groups face terms of 10 to 15 yearsafter conviction.[109]In the United Arab Emirates, the 2004 counterterrorism law makes joining orparticipating “in any manner” in a terrorist organizationpunishable by up to life imprisonment. The law requires that the person knowthe objectives of the organization.[110]US Definitions: Far-Reaching ConsequencesBroad definitions in US law of “terroristorganizations” have had far-reaching consequences for non-citizens whomay be subject to mandatory detention, for the ability of refugees to begranted protection from persecution, and for the rights to freedom of speechand association. This is particularly the case when these provisions arecombined with equally sweeping definitions of “terroristactivity” or “material support” to “terroristorganizations” (see chapter below).The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended US immigration law to require the detention of non-citizens alleged to be affiliated withterrorist organizations pending their removal from the United States, creating mandatory and potentially indefinite terms of detention (repeated periodsof six months if the non-citizen is believed by the attorney general to posea national security threat) and leaving only very limited access to judicialreview by habeas corpus petition.[111]Prior to September 11, US immigration law preventedentry to the US of non-citizens who engaged in “terroristactivity” or provided “material support to terroristorganizations.”[112] TheUSA PATRIOT Act expanded the definitions of terrorist organizations to groupspublicly listed by the US State Department, as well as two or moreindividuals who engage in, or have a subgroup that engages in, what theimmigration law defines as “terrorist activity.”[113] “Terrorist activity” was, in turn, expanded to include a range ofunlawful uses of a weapon or dangerous device other than for mere personalmonetary gain.[114] Similarly, in 2005, the REAL ID Act amended US immigration law to makedeportable any non-citizen involved in any of a long list of inadmissibilitygrounds, which, in effect, barred them from any form of asylum.[115]The broadened definitions in the USA PATRIOT and REAL IDActs have obstructed the entry to the United States of refugees who themselves had been victims of abuse, including rape survivors forced intodomestic servitude by rebel groups and those forced to pay money, serve asporters and cooks, or provide medical care to rebels.[116] Some discretion to waive the bar was adopted in law and regulations startingin 2007.[117] However, triggering such discretion is difficult for many refugees and asylumseekers and can be administratively complex, since in many cases threeexecutive departments must agree to waive the bar.IV. Material Support ofTerrorism andTerrorist OrganizationsFundraising for the purposes of terrorism, providing fundsto organizations defined as terrorist, or providing other forms of materialsupport are also acts made criminal under many counterterrorism laws. Materialsupport provisions are ostensibly intended to deter and punish those who wouldsupport a terrorist organization without taking part in terrorist acts. Butsuch provisions can be readily abused when combined with overly broad definitionsof terrorism, terrorist groups, or material support itself, and there is a lackof due process for material support suspects.Nearly 100 counterterrorism provisions reviewed by HumanRights Watch define material support for terrorism as a crime. Of those, 32required neither knowledge nor intent that the support could result in aterrorism-related offense—recklessness was sufficient.US federal criminal laws prohibit the provision of“material support or resources” to designated terroristorganizations and the provision of “material support” for thecommission of certain offenses that such groups might commit.[118] Material support has been defined to include, among other things, theprovision of financial services, currency, lodging, and transportation.Following the September 11 attacks, the USA PATRIOT Act and the US Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act expanded those laws toprohibit the provision of “expert advice or assistance,”“personnel,” “service,” and “training”to terrorist organizations.[119]In Holder v. Humanitarian LawProject, the US Supreme Court in 2010 rejected arguments that thesepost-September 11 provisions unconstitutionally infringe upon rights of freedomof speech or association, even when the activities undertaken were intendedsolely to promote peaceful dispute resolution and compliance with internationallaw.[120] Plaintiffs in that case included persons who sought to advocate for nonviolenceand respect for human rights with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, an armedKurdish organization in Turkey that the US secretary of state haddesignated as a “foreign terrorist organization.”[121]The court held, by a vote of six tothree, that the US Constitution permitted criminal prosecution of suchactivity. It ruled that there was no requirement that the expert advice,services, or training be intended to aid terrorist groups, simply that it mustbe provided “in coordination” with a terrorist group. Theinterpretation left open the possibility that conduct such as the provision oflegal assistance to alleged terrorism suspects could be prosecuted.[122] The sweeping legal restrictions—written so that they apply abroad, possiblyeven to non-US staff working in foreign organizations—madehumanitarian groups fearful of operating in regions of famine-stricken Somalia controlled by the armed Islamist group al-Shabaab. In 2011 the US government issued new guidelines on Somalia indicating that it was relaxingthe enforcement of sanctions relating to al-Shabaab, but without changing theunderlying legal rules.[123]France’s Internal Security Act of 2003 amended thepenal code to include the so-called “pimping for terrorism”offense, in which individuals can be charged with support for terroristactivities if they are unable to substantiate an income commensurate withtheir lifestyle while being closely associated with individuals who engagein terrorist acts.[124]Afghanistan’s Law on Combat against Terrorist Offensesof 2008 defines “support” as “providing financial source[sic], residence, training, shelter, counsel and assistance, falsificationof identification, communication equipment, and weapon, chemical, nuclearand other explosive substances, human resources, transportation servicesand other facilities.”[125] While the law stipulates that the person’s assistance must beintended to “complete the commission of offences,” its overlyvague language leaves the interpretation open to abuse.[126]In Australia, amendments to the criminal code in 2005outlaw the act of intentionally providing “support orresources” to an organization that would help that organizationengage in planning, assisting, or fostering the commission of a terroristact.[127] However, the overly broad language does not specify that the“support” must be “material.” The amendments alsobar persons from intentionally making funds available to another personwhere the first person is “reckless as to whether the other personwill use the funds to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act.”[128]Under Zimbabwe’s 2006 counterterrorism law, a personwho “solicits, invites or encourages moral or materialsupport” for a designated terrorist organization commits an offensepunishable by imprisonment of up to five years.[129]V. Limiting Free ExpressionDozens of countries’ counterterrorism laws imposecriminal penalties on speech, publications, or other forms of expression thatencourage, justify, incite, or lend support to terrorism. Security CouncilResolution 1624 of 2005 explicitly calls on states to “adopt suchmeasures as may be necessary and appropriate and in accordance with theirobligations under international law to [p]rohibit by law incitement to commit aterrorist act or acts.[130] Consistentwith international protections on the right to freedom of expression,governments may prosecute speech that incites criminal acts—speech thatdirectly encourages the commission of a crime, is intended to result incriminal action, or is likely to result in criminal action—whether or notcriminal action does, in fact, result.[131] Yetlaws that impose criminal punishment for what has been called “indirectincitement”—for example, justifying or glorifyingterrorism—encroach on expression protected under international humanrights law.Since 2001 there has been a clear trend toward tighteningrestrictions on speech perceived as encouraging terrorism. Human Rights Watchfound more than 50 laws that limit speech that encourages, justifies, orsupports terrorism but does not incite acts of terrorism.In 2008 Swaziland used its newly enactedcounterterrorism law to arrest Mario Masuku, leader of the banned PUDEMOpolitical opposition movement, on a charge of making a statement thatprovided “support to the commission of a terrorist act” andheld him for 340 days before a court acquitted him.[132] Swaziland had designated PUDEMO a terrorist organization under itscounterterrorism law, as noted above. Authorities also detained Masuku forseveral hours in 2010 for “mentioning” PUDEMO at the funeralof a man who died in police custody after being arrested for wearing aPUDEMO t-shirt at a Workers Day rally.[133]The UAE’s 2004 counterterrorism law provides for up tofive years of imprisonment for anyone who promotes, orally or in writing,any of the offenses set out in the law.[134]Under Bahrain’s 2006 counterterrorism law, anyonewho “promotes any activities that constitute a crime forimplementing a terrorist objective” is subject to a fine andpossible prison sentence. A prison sentence of up to five years is imposed“upon everyone who holds or possesses personally or through anotherperson a document or publication containing the aforesaid promotion whereit is intended to be distributed and also upon everyone who holds orpossesses any means of printing, recording, or publicizing regardless ofthe type thereof whether used or intended for use even on a temporarybasis for printing, recording or broadcast of such promotion.”[135]El Salvador’s counterterrorism law prescribes aprison sentence of 5 to 10 years for anyone who “publicly advocatesfor” or “incites” terrorism.[136] However it does not define “advocate” or“incite.”Saudi Arabia’s draft counterterrorism law of 2011criminalizes setting up or publishing a website “to facilitatecommunicating with leaders or any member of terrorist organizations or topropagate their ideas”—but includes no definition of whatconstitutes a terrorist organization.[137]Turkey’s counterterrorism law, revised in 2006,imposes criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment up to fiveyears on those who “make propaganda in connection with [terroristorganizations].”[138]The law provides for harsher penaltiesfor those who do so using the media.[139] A Council of Europe expert committee in 2007 criticized the provision,finding it to be “ambiguous and written in wide and vagueterms.”[140]Russia’s counterterrorism law of 2006 allowsauthorities to deny journalists access to special “counterterrorismoperations” zones where law enforcement officials have sweepingpowers of search and arrest. Authoritieshave invoked this provision to prevent journalists from reporting on lawenforcement crackdowns in areas of the volatile North Caucasus region suchas Ingushetia.[141]The Federal Law on the Mass Media was also amended in 2006to restrict reporting of counterterrorism operations.[142] The amendments ban the media from publicly justifying terrorism—aloose term that could be used as a censoring tool.[143] They also stipulate that “the procedure for collection of informationby journalists in the territory of a counterterrorism operation shall bedefined by the head of the counterterrorism operation.”[144] They forbid media outlets from disseminating information on special means,techniques, and tactics used in connection with an operation.[145] In addition, media cannot be used “for dissemination of materialscontaining public incitement to terrorist activity, of providing publicjustification of terrorism, or of other extremist materials.”[146]Twenty-nine European countries have signed the Council ofEurope Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, which requires states tocriminalize “public provocation” of terrorism, a crime thatcould include indirect incitement.[147] The convention defines public provocation as the public dissemination of amessage “with the intent to incite the commission of a terroristoffence, where such conduct, whether or not directly advocating terroristoffences, causes a danger that one or more such offences may becommitted.”Ethiopia: Journalists Sentenced as “Terrorists”In June 2012, Ethiopia’s Federal High Court used thecountry’s deeply flawed Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009 to convictsix journalists—along with 18 others including political opposition leaders—onterrorism-related charges,despite a lack of evidence and failure toinvestigate allegations that some defendants had beentortured. It wasthe country’s third high-profile “terrorism” verdict in sixmonths.[148]Eskinder Nega Fenta, an independent journalist and bloggerwho had been honored earlier in the year with the prestigious PEN/GoldsmithFreedom to Write award, was convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts,which carries a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment or death, as well as“encouragement of terrorism,” and “high treason.” Thefive other journalists were convicted in absentia.[149]Eleven journalists have been convicted under thecounterterrorism law, along with at least 4 opposition supporters and 19others.The June 2012 convictions were based on thecounterterrorism law’s most problematic provisions. Two of thejournalists tried in absentia, Mesfin Negash and Abiye Tekle Mariam,were convicted under the law’s article on support for terrorism, whichcontains a vague prohibition on “moral support.”[150] This provision is contrary to the principle of legality, which requires thatpersons be able to determine what acts would constitute a crime. Onlyjournalists have been charged and convicted under this article.All 24 defendants were initially charged with “terrorist acts,”which are defined so broadly that authorities can use the law to prosecutelawful, peaceful dissent.[151] Similarly, all defendants were initially charged with “encouragement ofterrorism.”[152] Thelaw’s definition of this offense does not require a link to incitementbut includes the publication of statements “likely to be understood asencouraging terrorist acts.” This could lead to charges for merelypublishing the names of organizations or individuals deemed to be terrorists.The defendants had no access to legal counselduring almost two months of pre-trial detention. Complaints of mistreatmentand torture by defendants were not appropriately investigated.Nathnael Mekonnen told the court that during his pre-trial detention he wastortured for 23 days, including being beaten, forced to stand for hours uponend, deprived of sleep, and having cold water repeatedly poured over him atthe country’s notorious Maekelawi facility. Credible sources told HumanRights Watch that the court did not investigate his complaints. According tocredible sources, Andualem Arage lodged a complaint after he was beaten by aconvicted prisoner on February 15 in Kaliti prison, but his complaint wasdismissed. The court prevented further questioning by defense attorneys andaccepted as fact the response by the prison administrator that contradictedAndualem’s claims, without further investigation, the sources said.[153]In January 2012, Ethiopia’s Federal High Court usedthe counterterrorism law to convict three otherjournalists—aswell astwo political opposition members—of conspiracy to committerrorist acts and participation in a terrorist organization, despite a lackof evidence and failure to investigate allegations that two of the reportersalsohad been tortured in detention. All five defendants were deniedaccess to counsel during three months in pretrial detention.According to the charge sheet, the evidence against thejournalists consisted primarily of online articles critical of the governmentand telephone discussions regarding peaceful protest actions. JournalistsWoubshet Taye Abebe of the now-defunct weekly Awramba Times and ReeyotAlemu Gobebo of the weekly Feteh were sentenced to 14 years in prison,while Elias Kifle, editor of the online Ethiopian Review, who wastried in absentia, received a life sentence.[154]That ruling came one month after two Swedish journalistswere each sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of “renderingsupport to terrorism,” based on their having illegally entered Ethiopia to investigate and report on abuses in Ogaden, eastern Ethiopia's Somaliregion.[155]Possession of PublicationsEven the possession of publications that support terrorismhas been made a criminal offense in some countries:Under the UK’s 2000 counterterrorism law, the possession ofarticles connected to terrorism—including terrorism-related publicationsor videos—is a criminal offense, so long as there is minimal showing thatthe person’s possession of the items may be related to plans to committerrorism. Specifically, the law provides that “[a] person commitsan offence if he possesses an article in circumstances which give rise to areasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with thecommission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.”[156] Another provision of the same lawcriminalizes the possession of documents containing information “of akind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act ofterrorism.” This extremely broad provision—which seemingly couldbar, for example, possessing a map of London—also provides that a personcharged with violating the law may defend against prosecution by proving thathe has “a reasonable excuse for his action or possession.”[157]Bahrain’s 2006 counterterrorism law provides thatpossessing a publication that promotes or approves of terrorist acts is a crimepunishable by five years of imprisonment.[158]Uzbekistan’s Criminal Code criminalizes the“publishing, storing, and distributing of materials containing ideas ofreligious extremism and fundamentalism.”[159]Since Uzbekistan’s laws lack any precise definition of the terms“religious extremism” and “fundamentalism,” they can beapplied to practically any kind of religious literature and, in practice, havebeen used expansively to persecute citizens for their perceived religious orpolitical convictions under the guise of counterterrorism. Many Uzbeks have beenimprisoned for possessing or distributing the literature of Hizb ut-Tahrir, anIslamist movement that seeks implementation of a strict Islamic doctrine andthe creation of an Islamic caliphate in Central Asia.[160] In some cases, the authorities rounded up and imprisoned members of Hizbut-Tahrir study groups and charged them with crimes including intent to commitsubversion for reading traditional Islamic texts as well as literaturepublished by Hizb ut-Tahrir.[161]VI. Restricting PeacefulAssemblySome counterterrorism laws specifically targetdemonstrations. In 2006 the UN special rapporteur on human rights andcounterterrorism noted “with concern the increase of infringements uponthe exercise of the right to freedom of assembly and association in the name ofcounter-terrorism.” Any limitations on this right “must be narrowlyconstrued as to their objective, i.e. counter-terrorism.”[162] Yet laws infringing on these rights continue to be used to quash legitimateprotest.The right to peaceful assembly is protected underinternational law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rightsallows restrictions on peaceful assembly only when “necessary in ademocratic society in the interests of national security or public safety,public order, … the protection of public health or morals or theprotection of the rights and freedoms of others.”[163]Some counterterrorism laws contain vaguely worded provisionsthat open the door to far-reaching restrictions on assembly. Saudi Arabia’s draft counterterrorism law, for example, would criminalize“organizing a demonstration, participating in its organization,assisting, calling for, or inciting it,” without any reference toterrorist acts.[164] Thesame article also criminalizes raising “banners or pictures that infringeupon the country’s unity or its safety, or that call for sedition anddivision among individuals in society, or inciting such acts.”Turkey: Jailed for Victory SignsSince 2008, the courts inTurkey have convicted hundreds of Kurdish protesters simply for participatingin protests the government deems to be sympathetic to the outlawed armedKurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The arrests are part of a broadercrackdown that also targets legal Kurdish political parties and perceivedsympathizers of the PKK and its alleged urban wing, the Union of KurdistanCommunities (KCK). In 2010 Human Rights Watch documented 26 cases ofprotesters prosecuted as terrorists under counterterrorism provisions enactedsince 2005 for activities such as shouting slogans, making victory signs,holding up banners, and in some cases throwing stones.[165]The government hassimilarly arrested individuals for alleged association with armedrevolutionary leftist political groups, among them the Revolutionary People’sLiberation Party/Front (DHKP-C), which Turkeylists as a terrorist organization. A number ofjournalists have been among those imprisoned on terrorism charges for allegedassociation with a group known as the Ergenekon gang, which allegedly plottedcoups against the government.Other examples of cases include:A university student, Murat Işıkırık,served a sentence of six years and three months for making a victory sign atthe March 2006 funeral procession in Diyarbakır for four PKK members,and clapping during a March 2007 protest on the campus at Diyarbakır'sDicle University. Released in November 2011, he faces further possible prisonsentences of around 20 months for “making propaganda for a terroristorganization” for the same activities.A mother of six, Vesile Tadik, was sentenced to seven years inprison for holding up a banner with a slogan “The approach to peacelies through Öcalan” during a December 2009 protest in Kurtalan,Siirt, against the prison conditions of the imprisoned PKK leader AbdullahOcalan. Her case is on appeal.In June 2012, a Turkish court convictedstudents Berna Yılmaz and Ferhat Tüzer to prison sentences of eightyears and five months for acts that included unfurling a banner at a protestthat read, “We want free education, we will get it,” during anevent attended by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in March2010. The students were convicted of membership in anarmed organization (DHKP/C) and making propaganda for the organizationstaging that protest, as well as for participating in similar non-violentprotests against the United States, the International Monetary Fund, and the WorldBank. They spent 19 months in detention during their trial and were releasedfrom prison in 2011. If the Court of Cassation upholds their sentences theywill spend four more years in prison.[166]In most cases, the courtscharged or convicted protesters, activists, and others using two provisionsof the Turkish Penal Code and Turkey’s counterterrorism law of 2006. Article 220/6of the penal code states that “a person who commits a crime on behalfof the organization although he or she is not a member of the organization shall also be punished as though a member of the organization”(emphasis added). Article 2/2 of Turkey’s Anti-Terror Law includes asimilar provision: “A person who is not a member of a terroristorganization, but commits a crime on behalf of the organization, is alsodeemed to be a terrorist offender and is punished as a member of theorganization.”[167] Article 314/2 of the penal code criminalizes membershipin an armed organization.[168] The courts also have charged journalists and otherswith “knowingly and willingly helping an organised criminalgroup” under article 220/7 of the penal code.VII. Broad Police PowersMore than 120 counterterrorism laws vastly expand policepowers to surveil, search persons and property, make arrests, and seize objectsand contraband in cases the police deem related to terrorism, in many caseswithout judicial warrant. By enhancing the ability of police forces to act withoutjudicial approval, and lowering—or removing altogether—the groundsof reasonable suspicion or probable cause ordinarily required to justify policeinterference, these laws may violate the right to privacy and encourage racialprofiling and the targeting of minorities.As the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) warned in2007, “[counterterrorism] laws, based on police discretion, reduce thepotential for oversight by courts and other accountability bodies, therebycreating an environment favourable to police misconduct and human rightsabuses.”[169]Warrantless Arrests and SearchesSeveral countries have enacted provisions permitting thepolice to conduct warrantless arrests and searches in “urgent”situations. Because many such laws do not provide a clear definition of“urgency” or specific criteria to serve as guidelines indetermining whether a case is urgent, they grant broad discretion to police toenter premises and search persons without prior judicial authorization.Such provisions can significantly reduce a suspect’sability to challenge the legality of a police search. This right is explicitlydenied where the provisions include clauses immunizing the police from civil orcriminal liability for their actions (see section below).Even under lawsthat do not specifically preclude challenges to the legality of police actions,courts may have no way of determining whether a case was legitimately one of“urgency” if the law does not provide clear criteria upon which tomake that judgment:The counterterrorism laws of Tanzania, Mauritius, and Gambia all include provisions that grant police a range ofpowers that can be exercised without a warrantin cases of urgency, where an officer above a certain rank determines thatapplying for a warrant would cause a delay prejudicial to public safety orpublic order. In such cases, the police are empowered to enter and searchpremises, search any persons or vehicles therein, seize property, and detainor arrest individuals.[170]Zambia’s counterterrorism law permits warrantlesssearches and seizures of property—but not warrantlessarrests—in cases of “urgency” in which the process ofobtaining a warrant would cause a delay that might be prejudicial topublic safety or order.[171]Under Uganda’s counterterrorism law, if aninvestigating officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a case is oneof “great urgency” and that “in the interest of theState, immediate action is necessary,” the officer may grant writtenauthorization for any other officer to enter and search premises, searchthe persons therein, and seize and retain property, all without a warrant.[172]Police powers granted under these provisions include the power to searchfor material categorized as “excluded material,” includingpersonal business records held in confidence, human tissue or fluid takenfor medical purposes held in confidence, and journalistic material held inconfidence.[173]Malaysia’s Security Offences (Special Measures) Billof 2012, which at this writing had been passed but not activated, allowspolice to make an arrest without a warrant if the officer merely“has reason to believe” that the person may be involved in securityoffenses, many of which are vaguely defined.[174] It also gives the police broad powers to conduct searches and interceptcommunications without judicial warrant. The government promoted the billas a rights-respecting reform of the notorious Internal Security Act, whichallowed indefinite detention without charge or trial of alleged terroristsand other national security suspects.[175]The UK’s 2000 Terrorism Act outlines a framework inwhich a police officer above a certain rank may authorize the warrantlesssearch of a premises (and persons therein) where the officer hasreasonable grounds to believe that the case is one of “greatemergency” and that “immediate action is necessary.”[176] The law does not, however, require officers to have reason to believe thatthe material being sought will be of value to a terrorist investigation.[177] No criteria are set out by the law to serve as guidelines in making such adetermination.[178]Australia’s Crimes Act, as amended in 2010, grantsfederal police broad powers to enter private premises without a warrant ifthe officer suspects that a “thing” is on the premises that isrelevant to a terrorism offense and that there is a serious and imminentthreat to a person’s life, health, or safety.[179] The Crimes Act does not define the term “thing.”Hungary’s TEK: “OrwellianPowers”Hungary’s Counter-Terrorism Centre, known by itsHungarian acronym TEK, is a counterterrorism force established in September2010 that can engage in secret surveillance, searches, and data collectionwithout a judicial warrant.[180] Thegovernment created the TEK to protect Hungary during its six-month rotatingpresidency of the European Union in January 2011, but retained the forceafter its rotation ended.[181]According to Kim Lane Scheppele, director of the Programin Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University, the TEK operates outsidethe regular security force command structure and has “amassed trulyOrwellian powers, including virtually unlimited powers of secret surveillanceand secret data collection.”[182]The TEK can secretly enter and search homes, engage inwiretapping, make audio and video recordings of people, search mail andpackages, and confiscate electronic data such as the content of computers andemail. Ordinary police in Hungary are allowed to enter homes or wiretapphones only after obtaining a warrant from a judge. The TEK, whose chief isappointed by the prime minister, requires only the approval of the justice ministerto carry out such activities.[183]The TEK also can compel financial and communicationscompanies and state agencies to secretly hand over data on individuals—includingbank records, phone logs, and tax filings—without requiring that therequests be linked to criminal investigations or approved by a prosecutor.[184]In 2012 the Budapest-basedEotvos Karoly Public Policy Institute filed a petition in Hungary’s Constitutional Court seeking to annul the provisionson secret surveillance without a judicial warrant, arguing that they violatedthe constitutional right to privacy.[185]Random Searches in Designated AreasMany counterterrorism laws also permit what are essentiallyrandom police searches of persons and their property within designated areas, whichin some cases encompass vast territory. Most such laws permit the designationof these areas by a member of the executive branch, at the request of thepolice, or by a member of the police force, on vaguely defined terms that aredifficult to review in court.These laws may encroach on the internationally protectedright to privacy, which has been interpreted to include the right to be freefrom arbitrary interference even if that interference is otherwise authorizedby law.[186] Inaddition, laws permitting such broad use of search powers may, in practice,have a disproportionate effect on minorities and sanction racial profiling bythe police:In Russia, Federal Law No. 35 onCounteracting Terrorism of 2006—enacted in the context of theongoing conflict with Islamist militant groups in the North Caucasus—vastlyexpanded the concept of a “counterterrorismoperations regime” as part of its efforts to quash insurgencygroups in the region.[187] While Russia’s previous counterterrorism law provided for territorial limitations on a counterterrorismoperation zone (a delimited territory, or a building or vehicle and the territory adjacent to it), the 2006law allows the head of counterterrorism operations in the region where the operation is conducted todetermine the territorial and temporal scope of the operation.[188] Duringcounterterrorism operations, security services and lawenforcement may conduct warrantless document checksand personal searches and impose limits on the free movement of people andvehicles.[189] The law does not specify preconditions that must exist for launching acounterterrorism operation. It only stipulates that a “counterterrorismoperation is conducted to repress a terrorist attack if there is no way to doso by other means.”[190]The law gives local security services the right tolaunch counterterrorism operations in their respective territories andexclusive rights and responsibility to determine the targets, timing, scope,and subjects of the operations.[191]It provides for large-scale use of militaryforces in counterterrorism operations.[192] The restrictions are similar to those invoked under astate of emergency. But in contrast to a state of emergency, counterterrorismoperations are not subject to parliamentary control and do not need to bereported to the UN or the Council of Europe.[193]Australia’s Crimes Act, as amended in 2005, grants thefederal police powers to question, search, and seize property fromindividuals and vehicles in areas that are designated “prescribedsecurity zones” by the executive, without requiring officers to havereasonable suspicion that searched persons might have committed, be committing,or be about to commit a terrorist act.[194]The designation of an area as a“prescribed security zone” is made by the ministers of homeaffairs and justice at the request of a police officer, if the officerconsiders that doing so would assist in “preventing” terroristactivity or responding to activity that has already occurred. Thedesignation may remain in force for up to 28 days—a period thatimposes a potentially unnecessary or disproportionate restriction onfreedom of assembly and expression.[195]UK: Abusive “Stop-and-Search” PowerHundreds of thousands of people were stopped and searchedwithout reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing under a provision of the UK’s 2000 counterterrorism law before it was scaled back in 2011 and replacedthe following year.The safeguards in the 2000 law were inadequate, and theabsence of a requirement of suspicion led to improper and inconsistent use ofthe law, which damaged relations between the police and ethnic minoritycommunities.[196]Section 44 of the law allowed an officer of the rank ofassistant chief constable or commander of a London police force to authorizethe police to stop and search both vehicles and pedestrians within a certainarea, without requiring any reasonable suspicion of the commission of anoffense.[197] In2011 the UK replaced these powers with a temporary order that requiredthat the officer making the authorization “considers it necessary forthe prevention of acts of terrorism,” although it did not providecriteria for making such a determination.[198] In2012 the UK permanently repealed the section 44 powerand replaced it with the Protection of Freedoms Act, which permits anauthorization to be made where a senior officer “reasonably suspectsthat an act of terrorism” will take place and the authorization is“necessary to prevent such an act.”[199]About 550,000 people were stopped and searched throughoutthe UK between April 2007 and October 2010 alone under section 44 of thelaw, yet not one person was successfully prosecuted for a terrorism offenseas a result.[200] Human Rights Watch’s research found that the police were stopping andsearching railway enthusiasts, photographers, and young children. HumanRights Watch also gathered anecdotal evidence that in some cases white peoplewere being stopped specifically to mask the extent to which ethnic minoritieswere being targeted.[201]The UKtemporarily suspended the stop-and-search power after theEuropean Court of Human Rights in 2010 rejected a final appeal by the UKagainst a ruling by the court that theprovisions violated the right to a private life and lacked “adequatelegal safeguards against abuse.”[202]In 2008 the UN special rapporteur on freedom ofreligion or belief concluded that the measure had a disproportionate impacton ethnic and religious minorities including persons of South Asian originand Muslims.[203]That same year, the UN Human Rights Committeerecommended that the UKreview the stop-and-search provision to ensureit was exercised in a non-discriminatory manner.[204]Expanded Surveillance PowersSurveillance operations conducted by the police can involveserious infringements on private life and commonly require the priorauthorization of a judge. Counterterrorism laws in more than 100 countriesgrant increased powers to the police to conduct surveillance without such priorcourt approval, instead allowing authorities who may lack impartiality, such asthe public prosecutor or the executive, to authorize the surveillance. Thisgreatly increases the risk that individuals will have their privacy violated orbe deprived of their liberty on vague and unspecified grounds:Malaysia’s Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Actof 2004 empowers the public prosecutor to authorize the police tointercept mail or telephone calls, enter any premises and install a devicefor the interception of communications, or require a communicationsservice provider to intercept a communication. The provision sets a lowstandard for the exercise of these powers, requiring only that the publicprosecutor consider the communication “likely to contain anyinformation relating to the commission of a terrorist offence,”without requiring that such a determination be made on any objectivelyverifiable grounds.[205]Uganda’s 2002 counterterrorism law allows theminister of internal affairs to grant broad powers to members of thepolice force, armed forces, or other security forces to interceptcommunications and “otherwise conduct surveillance” of personssuspected of committing terrorism offenses, without court approval.[206] Powers granted to authorized officers include intercepting telephonecalls, faxes, and emails; monitoring meetings; accessing bank accounts; andsearching the premises of any person. The provisions specify that anauthorized officer may make copies of communications, take photographs, or“do any other thing reasonably necessary” for the purposes ofthe subsection. The law also deems evidence collected as a result of suchsurveillance admissible in court.[207]Italy’s 2005 counterterrorism law enhancespre-existing powers of the intelligence services to conduct surveillancethrough the use of preventive wiretaps. Article 4 of the legislationallows such services to conduct wiretaps if a public prosecutor of anappeals court authorizes them as “indispensable” to gaininformation for the prevention of terrorism or subversive activities.[208]Indonesia’s 2002 counterterrorism law grants thepolice broad powers to intercept mail and packages delivered by post andother means, or to intercept phone communications for up to a year, incases where a magistrate has ordered an investigation.[209]Expanded Powers to Seize and QuestionThe counterterrorism laws of some countries bolster theability of police officers to seize property without a warrant and questionsuspects without regular due process protections during the course of terrorisminvestigations:Australia’s Crimes Act, as amended in 2005, allowsauthorized categories of police officers to demand the production ofdocuments thought on reasonable grounds to be relevant to theinvestigation of a serious terrorism offense, without the priorauthorization of a judge. The law makes it an offense to not comply withsuch a request by the police.[210]Amendments introduced in 2005 to Italy’s Penitentiary Law grant law enforcement officials expanded authority toquestion prison inmates seeking information relevant to crimes ofterrorism. The police already had authority to conduct interrogationswithout guaranteeing detainees the right against self-incrimination inorganized crime cases. Interviews conducted under this section of thePenitentiary Law may be carried out without the presence of a lawyer and,in cases the police designate as urgent, do not require prior judicialauthorization.[211]The UK 2008 Counter-Terrorism Act broadens policepowers to question individuals after charges have been filed. Ordinarily,police powers to conduct post-charge questioning are strictlycircumscribed under English law, and usually restricted to exceptionalcircumstances. Under the 2008 law, however, a judge may authorize thepolice to question an accused for a period of 48 hours, according to a setof broadly defined criteria: that it is “necessary in the interestsof justice,” that the police investigation is being conducted“diligently and expeditiously,” and that the questioning willnot “interfere unduly with the preparation of the person’sdefence.”[212] The law permits further 48-hour periods of questioning ifauthorized by a judge.The law also permits adverseinferences to be drawn at trial from an accused’s failure to answerpolice questions.[213] Whilepost-charge questioning is an appropriate method of limiting lengthy pre-chargedetention, allowing adverse inferences to be drawn from a suspect’ssilence violates the rights to remain silent and against self-incrimination.[214]VIII.Extending Pre-Charge Police CustodyMore than 40 countries have extended the period during whicha terrorism suspect may be detained by the police prior to being brought beforea judge or charged with a crime. The lengths of these extensions vary bycountry, as they did prior to the new legislation. The laws also differ on whenand even whether a judicial authority must give prior approval for thedetention.Prolonged detention withoutcharge, particularly when coupled with restrictions on detainees’ abilityto challenge that detention in court, creates conditions conducive to tortureand other ill-treatment that will go unnoticed by the courts and unsanctionedby law.Prolonged pre-charge detention, particularly when notauthorized by a judge, may also violate the right to liberty underinternational law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) states that anyone arrested or detained for a criminal offense“shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized bylaw to exercise judicial power.”[215] Furthermore, anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention has theright to “take proceedings before a court, in order that that court maydecide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his releaseif the detention is not lawful.”[216] The UNHuman Rights Committee, an international expert body that monitors statecompliance with the ICCPR, has explicitly interpreted this provision to applyto “all persons deprived of their liberty by arrest or detention,”including persons held in pre-charge detention.[217]Although international law does not impose specific limitson the length of time a person may be held before being brought before a judge,any prolonged period in police custody is not consistent with human rightsstandards. The Human Rights Committee has stated that “in criminal casesany person arrested or detained has to be brought ‘promptly’ beforea judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power. Moreprecise time-limits are fixed by law in most States parties and, in the view ofthe Committee, delays must not exceed a few days.”[218] In evaluating the European Convention’s provision on arbitrary detention,the European Court of Human Rights held that the “degree of flexibilityattaching to the notion of ‘promptness’ is limited” and thatconsideration of the particular features of each case “can never be takento the point of impairing the very essence of the right guaranteed … thatis to the point of effectively negating the State’s obligation to ensurea prompt release or a prompt appearance before a judicial authority.”[219]Pre-ChargeDetention Periods of a Few HoursThe following countries have extended the maximum length ofpolice custody by a number of hours:In Australia, police may detain an individual in order toinvestigate possible involvement in a terrorist offense for an initialquestioning period of four hours, extendable by the appropriate judicialofficer for an additional 20 hours—24 hours total—if necessaryto preserve or obtain evidence of that crime.[220] The initial four-hour period does not include up to seven days of“dead time”—periods during which the detainee issleeping, receiving medical attention, being paraded for identificationpurposes, or communicating with a lawyer, friend, relative, orinterpreter.[221] Non-terrorism suspects may be held for four hours, with the possibility ofextension for another eight hours—12 hours total.[222] As noted elsewhere in this report, however, other provisions of Australianlaw allow for longer detention periods for alleged terrorism suspects.Italy’s 2005 counterterrorism law doubles from 12 to24 the number of hours that a suspect may be held prior to being charged.[223] The detention does not require any prior judicial authorization andpersons detained under these provisions are not entitled to access legalcounsel.[224]Pre-ChargeDetention for Several DaysSeveral countries have extended potential pre-charge detentionperiods to a few days:Under France’s 2006 counterterrorism law, Frenchpolice may, in exceptional cases, request a judicial order to hold aperson for up to six days without charge or without being presented to ajudge.[225] ACouncil of Europe expert committee in 2007 concluded that this extendedtime period “raises questions concerning [the law’s]compatibility with Brogan and Others v. United Kingdom,” in which the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a periodlonger than four days and six hours was too long to be held withoutjudicial review.[226] Priorto the law’s passage, the standard 24-hour initial detention beforejudicial review could be extended by a judge an additional 72 hours, for atotal of four days, in cases of organized crime, terrorism, and drugtrafficking. Four days remains the standard length ofpolice custody in terrorism investigations.Antigua and Barbuda’s 2005 counterterrorism lawallows a judge to authorize the police to detain an individual for up tofive days in order to prevent the commission of a terrorist offense orinterference in the investigation of a terrorist offense.[227]Under the Philippines’ 2007 counterterrorism law,police may detain an individual suspected of having committed a terroristoffense or of links to an imminent terrorist offense without a judicialarrest warrant, and thus without charge and without judicial review, for amaximum of three days.[228] In cases involving non-terrorism offenses, such detention is limited to 12to 36 hours, depending on the seriousness of the offense.[229]Pre-ChargeDetention for a Week or LongerA number of countries allow pre-charge detention for a weekor longer:From 2006 to 2011, UK counterterrorism law allowed thedetention of a person suspected of a terrorism-related offense for up to28 days without charge, provided a judicial authority approved thedetention beyond an initial 48-hour maximum.[230] In January 2011, the UK allowed the maximum periodto revert to 14 days.[231] The UK had extended its maximum pre-charge detention period fromseven days under the 2000 counterterrorism law, to 14 days under the 2003law, to 28 days in 2006.[232] Then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government had in 2005asked Parliament to approve a 90-day detention period in terrorism cases,[233] and his successor, Gordon Brown, unsuccessfully sought extension of theperiod to 56 days and then 42 days in 2008.[234]Malaysia’s Security Offences (Special Measures) Bill of2012, which has yet to take effect, would reduce the initial period ofpre-charge detention for terrorism and other high-security suspects fromthe current 60 days to 28 days. However, the shorter period still exceeds internationalstandards for prompt judicial review, particularly when combined withother provisions, such as delays of 48 hours before the suspect is allowedaccess to a lawyer.[235]The bill is to replace the Internal SecurityAct, which allowed virtually indefinite detention without charge.[236]Almost 4,500 people were detained under theInternal Security Act between 2000 and 2010.[237]Indonesia’s counterterrorism law of 2002 establishesa seven-day detention period under which a person suspected of a terroristoffense may be held without charge and without judicial monitoring.[238] This contrasts with the standard one-day detention period provided for inthe Criminal Procedure Code.[239]Trinidad and Tobago’s Anti-Terrorist Act of 2005allows the detention of a person accused of involvement in a terroristoffense for up to 14 days without charge if they are interfering with orlikely to interfere with that investigation, provided a judge approves thedetention.[240] Underordinary criminal law, a suspect must be charged in court within 48 hoursof arrest.[241]An executive decree amending Fiji’s Public Order Actin 2012 allows pre-charge detention of suspects, including terroristsuspects, for two days, with an extension of 14 additional days at therequest of the police commissioner and with the consent of the interiorminister.[242]Algeria’s Code of Criminal Procedure generallypermits two days of pre-charge detention—“garde àvue.” Amendments passed in 2006 permit a total detention period of12 days for persons suspected of “subversive or terroristacts.”[243] Algerian law does not guarantee access to legal counsel during thisperiod, although it grants the detainee access to relatives.[244]Morocco’s 2003 counterterrorism law allowspre-charge detention of 96 hours, renewable twice, with the permission ofthe prosecutor. This effectively means that persons detained undersuspicion of terrorism can be held without being charged or brought beforea judge for a total of 12 days.[245] The law also allows prosecutors to delay access to counsel for up to sixdays during garde à vue for suspects accused ofterrorism-related offenses.[246]Under Swaziland’s 2008 counterterrorism law, a judgecan extend the detention of suspects to prevent the commission ofterrorism offenses, or interference in the investigation of such offenses,for up to one week. An initial detention order is limited to 48 hours butmay be extended to a maximum of 7 days.[247] The law does require the authorizing judge to specify the place andconditions under which the person shall be detained, as well as videorecording of the detainee “so as to constitute an accurate,continuous and uninterrupted record of the detention of that person forthe whole period of the detention.”[248]Under Zambia’s 2007 counterterrorism law, a police officermay, with the consent of the attorney general, seek a judge’s orderto detain a suspect for 14 days, with an extension to a total of 30 days,when there are “reasonable grounds to believe or suspect” thatthe person is “preparing to commit” or “is interfering,or is likely to interfere with” a terrorism-related offense.[249]The law provides that a detention order mustspecify the place of detention and conditions relating to access to agovernment medical official and the continuous video recording of theindividual’s detention.[250]Pre-ChargeDetention for a Month or LongerAt the far end of the spectrum, several countries allowpre-charge detention periods for a month or longer:Amendments passed in 2008 to India’scounterterrorism law allow a judge to double pre-charge detention from the90 days allowed under the Indian criminal code to 180 days upon a vaguelydefined special request from a prosecutor. The law allows the suspect toremain in police custody for up to 30 days of that period, double the15-day maximum period allowed under the Indian criminal code.[251] The Indian state of Maharashtra allows for similar detention periods.[252] Investigating police in India may also request that a terrorism suspect bereturned to police custody for further questioning after being released tojudicial custody.[253]Amendments in 2009 to Pakistan’s 1997 anti-terrorlaw triple the maximum period that a terror suspect may be detained—from30 days to 90 days—without the possibility to challenge thedetention in court.[254]Russia amended its Code of Criminal Procedure in 2004to allow detention of alleged terrorism suspects for 30 days withoutcharge, compared to 10 days for other criminal offenses.[255]Ethiopia’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009provides for “terrorist suspects” to be held for up to fourmonths without charge.[256]Saudi Arabia’s draft counterterrorism law of 2012would allow investigators of the Interior Ministry to order up to 120 daysof incommunicado detention of terrorism suspects, and a court may extendthat period indefinitely.[257]In Lebanon, an amendment to article 108 of the Code of CriminalProcedure adds terrorism to the list of crimes for which there is no timelimit on pre-charge detention. Article 108 already allowed such detentionof suspects in cases involving “homicide, felonies involving drugsand endangerment of state security, felonies entailing extremedanger,” and for persons convicted of a previous crime.[258]Under amendments enacted in 2002, Australia’s Security Intelligence Organisation may, with the consent of the attorneygeneral and an authorized judge, detain a person for up to one weekwithout charge for the purpose of collecting intelligence about aterrorist offense.[259] The provisions permit the indefinite extension of that detention insuccessive seven-day increments (“rolling warrants”) asjustified by additional information. The detainee must be informed aboutthe warrant authorizing the detention as well as his or her right tocontact a lawyer.[260]Pre-ChargeDetention without Judicial AuthorizationIn addition to increasing the duration of permissibledetention, several countries have increased the length of time a person may beheld without judicial authorization or review of the reasons for detention. Theduration of detention without judicial order varies greatly.In Israel, a 2006 law on criminal procedures for Israelidetainees suspected of security offenses extends the maximum detentionperiod without being presented to a judge from two to four days.[261]Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza are subject to other lawsand military orders, and may be detained without judicial authorizationfor up to eight days under military orders, and for up to 14 days withoutjudicial review under the 2002 Unlawful Combatants Law.[262]In Bahrain, the 2006 counterterrorism law has doubledpre-charge detention without judicial authorization from 7 to 15 days.[263]IX.Incommunicado DetentionAt least a dozen counterterrorism laws permit or encourageincommunicado detention during pre-charge custody, restricting detainees’right to receive visits by legal counsel, family members, and other interestedthird parties.Restrictions are usually for a specified time but in somecases also limit the circumstances in which lawyers may be present, as well asthe kinds of communication detainees may have with their counsel, familymembers, or other third parties that are not found in the regular criminalprocedure law.The connection between incommunicado detention and the useof torture has long been recognized. The UN Committee Against Torture hasstated that even where incommunicado detention does not involve the completeisolation of a detainee, “the incommunicado regime, regardless of thelegal safeguards for its application, facilitates the commission of acts oftorture and ill-treatment.”[264] The UNHuman Rights Committee recommends that states enact provisions againstincommunicado detention.[265] TheInternational Convention for the Protection of All Persons from EnforcedDisappearance, which went into effect in 2010 and has been ratified by 33states, bars incommunicado detention.[266]Restrictionson Legal CounselMore than two dozen counterterrorism laws specifically limitsuspects’ ability to meet with a lawyer:France reformed its code of criminal procedure in2011 to ensure that all detainees, including terrorism suspects, haveaccess to a lawyer while in police custody, including duringinterrogations, but it curtailed that access in exceptional cases forhigh-security suspects including alleged terrorists. All detainees areguaranteed access to counsel at the outset of detention but interrorism-related cases, the prosecutor may delay that access for 24hours. A special “liberty and detention” judge can then ordertwo subsequent postponements of one day each, in cases of imminent threatof a terrorist attack or because authorities deem it “imperative” for international cooperation. These exceptions meanthat terrorism suspects may be held and interrogated in police custody forup to three days before having access to a lawyer, as was the rule priorto the 2011 reform. If police custody is prolonged beyond three days, theterrorism suspect has access to a lawyer every 24 hours. Eachclient-lawyer interview is limited to 30 minutes.[267]Under schedule 8 of the UK’s Terrorism Act of 2000,access to a lawyer can be delayed for up to 48 hours if the police believethe access would interfere with evidence or lead to the alerting of othersuspects.[268] The UN Human Rights Committee in 2008 expressed concern about this featureof the law.[269] The UK police also may require that a detainee speak with a legalrepresentative “only in the sight and hearing of a qualifiedofficer” for the same reason.[270]Mauritius’ 2002 counterterrorism law provides that personsarrested on suspicion of terrorist offenses may be held in police custodyfor up to 36 hours and that a superintendent of police may order thatdetainees be denied access to anyone other than “a police officernot below the rank of Inspector, or a Government Medical Officer.”[271]The order requires only that the officer hasreasonable grounds to believe that access to other persons will lead tointerference with evidence, lead to the alerting of other suspects, orhinder the search and seizure of terrorist property.Gambia’s 2002 counterterrorism law contains avirtually identical provision to Mauritius law.[272]Other laws concerning access to legal representation allowlonger periods of incommunicado detention:Under revisions made in 2012 to China’s Criminal Procedure Law, authorities may detain suspects in detention for up to six months ata location determined by the police in cases involving terrorism, statesecurity, or serious instances of corruption. The revisions require lawenforcement authorities to notify relatives or counsel within 24 hours ofa detention; however, police are not required to disclose where or why theauthorities are holding the detainee.[273]Saudi Arabia’s 2011 draft counterterrorism law wouldrestrict the rights of terrorism suspects to be represented by a lawyer inevery stage of criminal proceedings, including during the interrogation,as Saudi law currently provides for other categories of suspects. Article13 restricts a suspect’s recourse to a lawyer to “a period ofsufficient time, determined by the investigation agency before raising thecharges to court.”[274]Amendments to Spain’s criminal procedural codepassed in 2003 more than doubled the period of time a terrorism suspectcould be held in incommunicado detention, to a total of 13 days upon theauthorization of a judge. The amendment allowed five days in police custodyfollowed by five days in judicial custody, with an additional three daysof pre-trial incommunicado detention at any time after the 10-day periodhas expired.[275]In Israel, the 1996 law on criminal procedures for Israeli detainees suspected of security offenses extended thetime period during which a detainee can be barred from contacting counselto a total of 21 days.[276]Israel’s 2002 Unlawful Combatants Law, as amended, also allowsPalestinian detainees to be denied access to lawyers for up to 21 days.[277] Further, Israeli military authorities may issue “preventionorders” barring Palestinian detainees’ access to lawyers forpurposes of interrogation for up to 90 days, with renewals if authoritiesdeem them necessary.[278]Under amendments in 2005 to Australia’s criminal code, a person subject to a preventive detention order has theright to contact and communicate with a lawyer, unless the policesuccessfully obtain a “prohibited contact order.”[279]Although detainees may contact a family member, they are restricted inwhat can be communicated and may not disclose the fact that a detentionorder has been made, the fact of the detention, or the period for which heor she is being held.[280]The contact is limited to “letting the person contacted know thatthe person being detained is safe but is not able to be contacted for thetime being.”[281] All contact with lawyers and visitors may be monitored by policeexercising the preventive detention order.[282] The provisions also require that any detainee’s communication withlawyers, family members, or employers be made in a way that can bemonitored by the police.The law does, however, provide that suchcommunications are not admissible as evidence against the person in court.[283]DelayingNotification to Family MembersSeveral countries—including Australia, noted above—passed laws in the wake of September 11 permitting the police todelay notifying family members and other third parties—in addition tolawyers—that an individual is being held and to otherwise restrict ordeny their communications with or access to interested third parties:The UK police may delay implementing detainees’rights to have a friend, relative, or interested third party informed oftheir whereabouts if they have “reasonable grounds forbelieving” it would hinder the investigation, even though theserights are explicitly affirmed in the same counterterrorism law.[284]The expanded provisions forincommunicado detention in Spainnullify the right of persons detained tohave a family member or other third party notified of the fact ofdetention and the place where they are being held. Moreover, the right toreceive visitors and otherwise correspond with a religious minister,relative, or other interested party who might advise the detainee is alsorescinded in terrorism cases.[285]As notedabove, in Israel a 1996 law applicable to detainees suspected ofsecurity offenses, and the 2002 Unlawful Combatants Law applicable tonon-citizens, allow for detention without the ability to contact lawyersfor up to 21 days. In practice, Israeli authorities have also preventedPalestinians from contacting their families for extended periods and fromseeing doctors of their choosing.[286] The UN Committee Against Torture concluded in 2009 that Palestiniansdetained under Israeli administrative detention regulations, particularlywhen detained inside Israel rather than in the occupied territories,“may be de facto in incommunicado detention for an extended period,subject to renewal.”[287]X. Restricting Rights to Challenge DetentionA small number of counterterrorism laws have provisions thatrestrict the rights of detainees to learn the basis for their detention or toparticipate in court procedures related to their cases prior to trial.Suchrestrictions may violate detainees’ right to challenge the basis fortheir detention, a right provided under international law:[288]Bahrain’s 2006 law permits a 10-day extension of theinitial 5-day period of detention without charge (as ordered by a publicprosecutor rather than judicial authority) and authorizes security forcesto request extensions on the basis of confidential information that isneither provided to detainees nor can be challenged by them in court.[289]According to Israel’s 2006 criminal procedureprovisions applicable to detainees suspected of security offenses, in somecases a judge may order the detention of a detainee for up to 20 days in ahearing where the detainee is not present.[290] Under Israel’s 2002 Unlawful Combatants Law, a person does not havethe right to be present when the “incarceration order” isgranted, although the order must “be brought to the attention of theprisoner at the earliest possible date.”[291] Finally, court hearings to authorize continued detention are conducted incamera (not in public) and the court may rely on secret evidence notprovided to the detainee or defense counsel if the court “isconvinced that disclosure of the evidence … is likely to harm Statesecurity or public security.”[292]While counterterrorism legislation in the UK affords detainees the opportunity to set forth the reasons against extendingtheir detention before a judge and states that they are “entitled tobe legally represented at the hearing,” it also allows judges toexclude both detainees and their lawyers from any and all parts of thosehearings at their discretion.[293]Turkey’s Anti-Terror Law, revised in 2006, allowsfor a partial or total restriction of the right of a suspect and thedefense lawyer to access the case file and the evidence against a suspecton the grounds that the criminal investigation may be endangered.[294] At this writing, the Turkish government was preparing to limit this periodof restriction to three months after Council of Europe Commissioner forHuman Rights Thomas Hammarberg raised concerns that the current provisionscould prevent suspects from effectively challenging the lawfulness oftheir detention, making the provisions incompatible with the case law ofthe European Court of Human Rights.[295]XI.Reducing Police AccountabilityIn some countries, provisions in counterterrorismlegislation protect or even explicitly immunize members of the police or othersecurity forces from civil or criminal liability for serious violations ofhuman rights. Such provisions subvert the rule of law and run contrary to theright to an effective remedy under international law, which requires states toensure that individuals whose rights are violated have the means to legalrecourse.[296] Inaddition, these laws may have the effect of condoning abuses by the securityforces and as such may affect state compliance with other internationalobligations, such as the prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment andinfringements on the right to privacy. Some countries also absolve othergovernment officials from accountability for abuses committed duringenforcement of their counterterrorism laws.ExplicitImmunity ProvisionsSome counterterrorism laws contain sweeping immunityprovisions for the police when injury, death, or damage to property occurs as aresult of their actions:Mauritius’ counterterrorism law of 2002 grants lawenforcement officers immunity from civil or criminal liability for the useof force “as may be necessary for any purpose” that results ininjury or death to any person or damage or loss of any property.[297]Gambia’s 2002 counterterrorism law contains analmost identical provision to that of Mauritius.[298]Belarus’ 2002 law states that “people involvedin the fight against terrorism, in accordance with the legislation of RB[Republic of Belarus], are exempt from responsibility for damage inflictedduring the conduct of a counterterrorism operation.” It does notdefine “people.”[299]Other countries have passed laws that contain immunityprovisions precluding court challenges to any action taken by the police infurtherance of the law:Before its repeal in 2004, India’s Prevention ofTerrorism Act of 2002 provided that “no suit, prosecution or otherlegal proceeding” could be brought against either the federal orstate governments or their authorities or “any other authority onwhom powers have been conferred” under the Act “for anythingwhich is in good faith done or purported to be done in pursuance” ofthe act. It also shielded any serving or retired member of the armedforces or paramilitary forces from prosecution for counterterrorism actstaken “in good faith.”[300] (Under India’s Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958, armedforces have for decades enjoyed immunity for actions in“disturbed” areas that include shooting to kill andwarrantless search and arrests.)[301]A counterterrorism law enacted in 2005 in Antigua andBarbuda contains a provision that prevents any civil or criminallegal proceedings against the police commissioner or the director of theOffice of National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy for exercisingtheir powers to seize property they suspect to be connected to thecommission of a terrorist offense.[302]Uganda’s 2002 counterterrorism law contains aprovision under which “no police officer or other public officer orperson assisting such an officer is liable to any civil proceedings foranything done by him or her, acting in good faith, in the exercise of anyfunction conferred on that officer under this Act.”[303]Sri Lanka’s 2006 counterterrorism regulationsinclude a provision providing immunity to any public servant or otherperson “specifically authorized by the Government of Sri Lanka totake action” under the laws, “provided that such person hasacted in good faith and in the discharge of his official duties.”[304]Saudi Arabia’s draft 2011 counterterrorism law“exempts [all government officials] from criminal responsibilitythat may attach to them in carrying out the duties in this law.”[305]XII. Military and OtherSpecial CourtsSome countries haveestablished special counterterrorism courts that do not meet internationalstandards for independence and impartiality or that restrict guaranteed proceduralrights of defendants. In some cases, special courts were established yearsearlier, but their use expanded dramatically following the attacks of September11 or large-scale attacks by armed groups in the country in question. At leastfour countries have granted military courts jurisdiction over terrorism prosecutions,while at least three dozen allow the use in regular courts of specialprocedures for terrorism suspects—many of which violate internationallaw, such as shifting the burden of proof to the defendant for certainoffenses.According to the UN Human Rights Committee,Trials of civilians by military or special courts should beexceptional,[306] i.e.limited to cases where the State party can show that resorting to such trialsis necessary and justified by objective and serious reasons, and where with regardto the specific class of individuals and offences at issue the regular civiliancourts are unable to undertake the trials.[307]Human Rights Watch opposesall special courts for so-called national security crimes because they tooeasily can be and too often are used to try peaceful dissidents on politicallymotivated charges, and because important due process protections for suspectsand evidentiary standards are often lacking or fall far short of internationalhuman rights standards.The right to justice and a fair trial is guaranteed ininternational human rights law. The International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights (ICCPR) states that any hearing must take place in open courtbefore a “competent, independent and impartial tribunal.”[308] Closed hearings are permitted only in exceptional cases for narrowly tailoredreasons of privacy, justice, or national security. Among other fair trialprotections, the ICCPR provides for the right of the accused to counsel, to bepresent at hearings, and to call and examine witnesses.[309] The United States is among the more notorious examples of countries whosespecial courts erode fair-trial rights:The United States created military commissions at theUS military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to try suspects apprehendedin the “global war on terror.”Originally authorized bythen-president George W. Bush in November 2001, they were reauthorized inmodified form via legislation passed by Congress in 2006 and again in 2009after Barack Obama was elected president. The military commissions providesignificantly fewer due process protections than US federal courts. Defense Department authority to appoint the military judges and intervenein other aspects of the case undermines the independence of thecommissions and fair trial rights. The ad hoc nature of commissionprocedures ensures an uneven playing field between prosecution anddefense.[310] While the previous military commissions law barred torture, it allowedevidence obtained by cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and in somecircumstances may have allowed evidence obtained by torture. Currentmilitary commission rules do not permit evidence obtained directly bytorture; however, so-called “derivative evidence” obtained bytorture may be admitted, as well as coerced evidence from someone otherthan the defendant.[311]In response to a string of deadly attacks in Nigeria by militant groups including Boko Haram, President Goodluck Jonathan in 2012reportedly was preparing amendments to the country’scounterterrorism law of 2011 that would require groups designated as“enemy combatants” to be tried before military panels ratherthan civilian courts. Local media quoted a presidential source as sayingthe measure aimed to “curb the excesses of some lawyers” incivilian court.[312]Malaysia’s counterterrorism law of 2012, which hasyet to take effect, allows courts to shield the identity of certainprosecution witnesses from defendants and their attorneys, depriving themof their right to cross-examine the witnesses against them.[313] The law permits the use in court of any information obtained in raids andinvestigations, as well as all intercepted communications—potentiallyencouraging the unlawful collection of evidence.[314] It also permits a court to order the continued detention of an acquitteddefendant pending the exhaustion of all prosecution appeals, thus allowingthe authorities to keep a person who has been found not guilty behind barsfor years.[315]Russia in 2009 amended the country’s penal codeto end jury trials for terrorism or treason suspects and gave prosecutorsbroader investigative authority in such cases. The provisions orderedterrorism suspects to be tried instead by three-judge panels.[316] Russia’s Constitutional Court in 2010 rejected arguments that theamendments violated Russia’s Constitution, which guarantees theright to trial by jury and bars passage of laws that abrogate or derogatefrom human rights, ruling that jury trials only apply to cases involvingthe death penalty.[317]Yemen’s Specialized Criminal Court—establishedin 1999 to hear cases related to crimes such as terrorism and piracy—routinelyfails to meet “fair and public hearing” standards of theICCPR. The court dramatically increased its activities after September 11,prosecuting dozens of alleged terrorism cases. Yemeni lawyers representingsuspects prosecuted by the special court have repeatedly alleged they arenot allowed to see clients’ case files in full or for sufficienttime and that the proceedings are plagued with irregularities and resultin convictions for which little or no evidence is put forward.[318]Turkey’s special aggravated felony courts, establishedin their present form in 2004, prosecute terrorism offenses as well ascrimes against state security and organized crime. They depart fromordinary criminal procedures on multiple levels, some of which restrictdefense rights. Among these are longer police custody and prison detentionperiods, with the upper limit for detention on remand being twice as longas is the case with other offenses tried in regular aggravated felonycourts; special restrictions to the case file and evidence; and the powerto disregard the few restrictions under the county’scounterterrorism law to the state’s interceptions of communicationsand surveillance.[319]Council of Europe Commissioner for Human RightsThomas Hammarberg has raised concerns about restriction of the right todefense before these courts and “the potential creation of atwo-track justice system.”[320]Saudi Arabia: Closed ProceedingsIn Saudi Arabia, terrorism suspects are tried by aSpecialized Criminal Court whose existence the authorities revealed in 2008without publication of any authorizing law.[321] The court’s decisions are subject to executive approval; for example,the minister of interior, but not the court, can release a convicted prisonerserving a sentence (as well as a pre-trial detainee).[322]In 2008 the Justice Ministry announced it had appointedcertain sitting judges to constitute the court to hear a first set of closeto 1,000 terrorism cases to begin in 2009. The special court held all trials incamera and did not allow the accused the right to access legal counsel.It convicted 330 persons and acquitted only one in the first set of trials.[323]In April 2011 a prosecutionspokesperson said that over 2,000 suspects were being referred to trialbefore the special court, while another 5,000 suspects had been releasedafter “repenting.” In June 2011 local but not international mediawere allowed access to some trials, though reporting appeared to be heavilycensored or self-censored.[324]The special court is empowered to hear witnesses andexperts without the presence of the accused or their lawyer, who only receivea notice of the contents of what was said without revealing the identity ofthe expert, making it difficult to challenge the veracity or validity of thetestimony.[325] Itcan conduct trials in absentia, and those who are convicted are onlygranted the right of appeal, not of retrial, if apprehended.[326]A Human Rights Watch investigation found that the specialcourt is increasingly used to try peaceful dissidents and human rightsactivists on politically motivated charges in proceedings that violate theright to a fair trial.[327] InApril 2012, for example, the court sentenced a rights activist and apolitical dissident to prison for peacefully questioning abuse of governmentpower. The charges against the rights activist and the dissident do notallege that they used or incited violence.In 2012 activist Muhammad al-Bajadi was tried by a special court. Al-Bajadiis a founding member of the Saudi Association for Civil and Political Rights(ACPRA), which the government has not licensed. Intelligence agents hadarrested al-Bajadi on March 20, 2012, after several dozen families ofdetainees had gathered in front of the Interior Ministry in Riyadh topress officials for the release of their relatives, some of whom had beendetained for seven or more years without trial.On April 10 the court sentenced al-Bajadi to four years inprison and banned him from foreign travel for another five years for unlawfullyestablishing a human rights organization, distorting the state’sreputation in media, impugning judicial independence, instigating relativesof political detainees to demonstrate and protest, and possessing censoredbooks.On April 11, 2012 the court also sentenced Yusuf al-Ahmad,an academic and cleric, to five months in prison for “incitementagainst the ruler, stoking divisions, harming the national fabric,diminishing the prestige of the state and its security and judicialinstitutions, and producing, storing, and publishing on the internet thingsthat can disturb public order.” On July 7, 2011 al-Ahmad had publisheda video on his Twitter account in which he called on King Abdullah to releasearbitrarily detained persons.Other countries have established special rules forterrorism trials that represent an erosion of due process guarantees under thestate’s normal criminal procedure or international law. For example, somerules allow hearsay evidence that would be inadmissible in regular court,permit the use of confessions made under torture or duress, and establishstrict limits on the appeal of convictions:Ethiopia’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009 provides forthe use of “hearsay or indirect evidence” in court without anylimitation. Ethiopia’s Code of Criminal Procedure bars courts from usingforced confessions or statements.[328] However, there is no similar provision in the counterterrorism law. Officialintelligence reports also are admissible, even if they do not disclose theirsource or how their information was gathered.[329] In this manner, intelligence reports based on information gathered throughtorture could be admitted into evidence at trial; if defense counsel cannotascertain the methods by which intelligence is collected, they cannot show ithas been collected in a coercive manner.[330] Some rules shift the burden of proof to the accused,jeopardizing the right to be presumed innocent under international law.[331] According to the International Commission of Jurists, “If adisproportionate burden is placed on the accused to prove facts, or to prove alack of criminal intention, the [right to be presumed innocent] is effectivelyset aside.”[332]Uganda’s Anti-Terrorism Act imposes up to five yearsof imprisonment for destroying material likely to be relevant to aninvestigation, "unless the accused persons can prove thatthey had no intention of concealing any information contained in thematerial in question from the person carrying out the investigation.”[333]In India, a counterterrorism amendment passed in 2008 directsspecial courts to presume the guilt of an accused in two circumstances withouta showing of criminal intent. The first is if arms, explosives, or otherspecified substances were recovered from the accused and there is reason tobelieve they or similar items were used to commit an offense under the UnlawfulActivities (Prevention) Act. The second is in cases where fingerprints or other“definitive evidence” suggesting involvement were found at the siteor on anything used in the commission of the offense.[334] In such cases, the burden of proof is placed on the accused to prove theirinnocence. This measure undermines India’s constitutionally guaranteedright to a fair trial and creates enormous risks of wrongful prosecution,particularly given the record of the Indian police in fabricating evidence.[335]XIII.Death PenaltyCounterterrorism laws unsurprisingly prescribe tougherpenalties for terrorism-related offenses than do ordinary criminal laws for thesame underlying acts. Human Rights Watch found that more than 120 countries hadenacted laws with heightened penalties for terrorism-related acts sinceSeptember 11. Security Council Resolution 1373 called for those responsible forperpetrating or supporting terrorist acts to be prosecuted byterrorism-specific domestic laws and regulations for which “thepunishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist acts.”[336]At least 30 countries thatmaintain the death penalty include capital punishment as a sentence for certainterrorist acts. These include Bahrain, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. The list also includes Arab countries with lawsbased on Sharia, or Islamic law.Terrorist crimes in Saudi Arabia, for example, are considered crimes of hiraba;these crimes are said to warrant the highest penalties set out in theQuran, including the death penalty.[337]International law discourages the use of the death penaltyand mandates that it only be applied to the most serious crimes, such as thoseresulting in death or serious bodily harm.[338] In2008 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Moratorium onthe use of the death penalty,” in which 104 states voted in favor.[339] Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as cruel andinhuman punishment, one that is plagued with arbitrariness, prejudice, anderror wherever it is applied.Belarus: Executions Defying Stay OrderIn March 2012 Belarus executed two men convicted onterrorism-related charges for a deadly bombing the previous year, ignoring a requestfrom the UN Human Rights Committee to stay the execution until the committeeconsidered one suspect’s petition that his conviction was based on anunfair trial and a forced confession.In November 2011 a Belarus court convicted UladzislauKavalyou and Dzmitry Kanavalau of carrying out an attack on the Minsk metroin April 2011 that killed 15 people and wounded hundreds. Kanavalau was foundguilty of committing terrorist attacks and producing explosives. Kavalyou wasfound guilty of assisting him and failing to inform the authorities.[340] Both were sentenced to death.Independent experts and human rights groups repeatedlyexpressed their concerns about due process and other fair trial violationsduring the investigation and trial. Kavalyou’s mother alleged in apetition to the Human Rights Committee that her son was tortured intoconfessing.[341] Noforensic evidence was presented at the trial linking either defendant to theexplosion. Relatives were only notified of the executions after the two menhad been put to death.[342]The Human Rights Committeecalled the executions “flagrant violations” of Belarus’ legal obligations. It stated that it “hadasked the Belarus authorities to stay the execution pending its considerationof the case. Such requests are binding as a matter of internationallaw.”[343]Belarusis the only remaining country in Europe that usesthe death penalty. It was among the first countries to pass acounterterrorism law following the September 11 attacks.[344]Capital Punishment for Non-LethalCrimesWhile in some countries capital punishment may only beimposed when an act of terrorism results in a person’s death, in morethan a dozen others it is prescribed as a penalty for crimes that do not resultor threaten death or serious injury:Under Syria’s penal code, any terrorist act that results ina person’s death is punishable by the death penalty, as is any terroristact that results in the destruction (even partial) of a public building ortransportation vessel.[345]Indonesia’s 2002 counterterrorism regulations establish thedeath penalty as a possible sentence for acts of terrorism including those thatdo not cause death or serious injury. For example, the death penalty may beused to punish the act of transporting or hiding a firearm or “other dangerousmaterial,” if the material is transported or hidden with the intent ofcommitting a terrorist act. Incitement to terrorism is also punishable by deathor by life imprisonment.[346]Saudi Arabia’s draft 2011 counterterrorism law introduces thedeath penalty for 23 acts and specifies minimum sentences, typically 10 to 25years, without also specifying a maximum sentence. The law would allow thedeath penalty for crimes that threaten rather than involve violence.[347]The United Arab Emirates’ 2004 counterterrorism laweffectively allows the death penalty for anyone who is involved in thesuccessful perpetration of a terrorist act, such as organizing or running aterrorist organization, inciting someone to commit a terrorist act that causesdeath, and hijacking a means of transport to commit a terrorist act that causesdeath. If the terrorist act in question is planned but not carried outsuccessfully, the penalty is life imprisonment.[348]Not all countries have increased penalties for terrorist acts. In2007 Peru’s Congress tabled draft legislation submitted the previous yearby President Alan Garcia that proposed to prescribe the death penalty forcertain terrorist offenses, but only following court challenges.[349] The legislation would have violated the rule in the American Convention onHuman Rights that the set of crimes punishable by the death penalty should notbe expanded.[350]XIV. Preventive Detention and“Control Orders”More than a dozen countrieshave initiated or expanded the use of administrative (or preventive) detentionor restrictions on suspects’ activities as part of counterterrorismefforts.Administrative detention entails the deprivation of libertyby the executive with no intent to prosecute the individual through thecriminal justice system. In theory, detainees are not deprived of their libertyas punishment for past acts but in order to prevent future unlawful acts.Consequently, administrative detention results in the detention or restrictionon movements of persons—sometimes indefinitely—without chargingthem with a criminal offense or bringing them to trial.Under administrative orpreventive detention law, detainees may be held in police custody or in in thecustody of the military or the intelligence services. A number of countries,particularly in Asia and the Middle East, inherited administrative detentionlaws from colonial governments, which frequently had used them to quash localindependence movements.International human rights law permits administrativedetention only under narrow circumstances.[351] However, countries often use administrative detention for matters that fallsquarely within the application of existing criminal law, with the intent ofavoiding the scrutiny of an independent and qualified justice system. Or theyuse such laws to deprive individuals of fundamental freedoms—such as therights to association, expression and peaceful assembly—protected underinternational law. As such, administrative detention subverts the rule of lawby granting executive officials powers that should properly be the domain ofthe judiciary.Administrative DetentionAdministrative detention laws may limit detention to a fewdays or effectively allow indefinite detention:Since the September 11 attacks, the United States has asserted wartime powers in the US Constitution and domestic laws to indefinitelydetain several hundred terrorism suspects without charge and in many caseswithout judicial review. In March 2009 the government asserted in court filingsthat a resolution passed by Congress immediately after the September 11 attackswas the legal basis for detaining thousands of detainees without charge atGuantanamo Bay as well as in Bagram, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.[352] The resolution, the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),allowed the president to use military force against persons responsible for theSeptember 11 attacks or anyone who harbored those responsible.[353]Provisionsapplicable to terrorism suspects in the USNational Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year2012 codify indefinite detention into domestic law. The provisions permit theindefinite detention of detainees at the USmilitary base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as well as of anyfuture terrorism suspects.[354]The law also bars the transfer ofdetainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay into the United States for any reason, including for trial. In addition, it extends restrictions,imposed in 2011, on the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo to home or thirdcountries—even those cleared for release by the US government.[355]Of the 169 detainees who remain atGuantanamo—some of whom have been held for over a decade—only sixhave been formally charged.[356]In Australia, the Criminal Code permits preventivedetention for up to 96 hours if the arresting officer has“reasonable grounds” to suspect an imminent threat of aterrorist act and that the detention would “substantiallyassist” in preventing the attack.[357] The first 48 hours can be authorized by a senior member of the Australianfederal police, and an additional 48 hours can be authorized by aspecifically designated sitting or retired judge, a federal magistrate, oran administrative appeals tribunal member.[358] The amendments allow the detention to remain virtually secret, with noprovisions for appeal.[359]Until their expiration in 2007,amendments to Canada’s criminal code permitted the police to detaina person for a total of 72 hours without charge if they determined it wasnecessary to prevent terrorist activity.[360] The measure allowed a police officer to apply for an arrest warrant on thebasis of “reasonable grounds” to believe that a terroristactivity would be carried out, but with the lower standard of“reasonable suspicion” that the detention of the targetedperson was necessary to prevent the terrorist activity.[361]Bosnia and Herzegovina: Detention of Foreign SuspectsFollowing the attacks of September 11, 2001, Bosnia andHerzegovina came under pressure from the United States and other governments to clamp down on former foreign fighters with alleged links toterrorist groups, such as by stripping naturalized Bosnians of theircitizenship. In 2008 Bosnia passed a law permitting indefinite detention offoreign terrorism suspects without charge, even when the authorities are nottaking active steps to remove them from the country.The six suspects detained under that law include Imadal-Husin, who remains behind bars in defiance of a court ruling and who hasnever seen nor been able to contest the evidence that led the Bosnianauthorities to conclude that he is a threat to national security.[362]Syrian-born al-Husin, who served in the El Mujahid unit offoreign fighters in the Bosnian army during the armed conflict in the early1990s, was stripped of his Bosnian citizenship in 2001 on unspecifiedsecurity grounds and has been detained without charge since 2008.In 2012 the European Court of Human Rights blocked Bosnia’s efforts to deport al-Husin to Syria on grounds that he riskedill-treatment if returned to Syria because of widespread torture in detentionthere and the country’s general security situation. The court alsofound that his extended immigration detention in Bosnia at a time when thegovernment was not taking active steps to deport him violated his right toliberty.[363]The court called on Bosnian authorities find a thirdcountry that would accept al-Husin, bring criminal charges against him, orrelease him.[364] Bosnia’s allies have been silent about al-Husin’s indefinitedetention without charge.[365]Security forces in the Middle East and elsewhere have heldterrorist suspects in administrative detention with little regard for basic dueprocess rights:Singapore’s Internal Security Act allows the indefinitedetention of anyone deemed a threat to national security.[366]A number of suspected members of the Islamist militant group Jemaah Islamiyahare currently held under the law. The Internal Security Act was passed in 1960in Malaysia; Singapore retained the law after separating from Malaysia in 1963.Saudi Arabia’s 2011 draft counterterrorism law compelsterrorism detainees to undergo “rehabilitation” measures regardlessof whether they have been convicted of any crime. Article 62 sets up specialcenters for the education of detainees and convicts in terrorism cases,“in order to rectify their ideas, and to deepen their attachment to thehomeland.” Interior Ministry investigators may order a terrorism suspector convict, “or whoever is surrounded by suspicion or instillsfear,” to participate in rehabilitation centers in lieu of detention.[367] The law also allows a committee set up by the Interior Ministry to continueadministrative detention for persons convicted of terrorism crimes whosesentence is about to end. The committee’s decisions are subject to appealto the specialized court.[368]Israel: Indefinite DetentionIsrael’s Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law,amended with further restrictions in 2008, allows for the administrativedetention of Palestinians from the occupied territories if there is“reasonable cause to believe” that the individual “hasparticipated either directly or indirectly in hostile acts against the Stateof Israel or is a member of a force” that perpetrates such acts.[369]A person so detained may be held initially for up to 14days prior to judicial review.[370]The law states that such a person“shall be regarded as someone whose release will harm state security aslong as the hostilities of that force against the State of Israel have not ended, as long as the contrary has not been proved.”[371] The law further states that the defense minister’s determination thatthe hostilities of the force against Israel are ongoing “shall serve asevidence in any legal proceeding, unless the contrary is proved.”[372]In practice, Israel has enforced the Unlawful Combatants Law againstPalestinians from the Gaza Strip.Israeli military orders also allow for the administrativedetention of Palestinians.[373]Under both the Unlawful Combatants Law and military orders, a judge (or amilitary judge, respectively) may approve a further detention period of up tosix months, a period that may be renewed indefinitely as long as the judgeconcurs that releasing the person would harm security.[374] Under military orders, administrative detainees are detained on the basis ofsecret evidence, which they and their lawyers are not permitted to see, thatthe detainee presents a security threat.[375]Because the military does not indict administrativedetainees for any particular offense, detainees are unable to defendthemselves against specific charges. The standard of evidence is also lowerthan in a criminal proceeding – not proof “beyond a reasonabledoubt,” but merely “reasonable grounds to assume” that thedetainee might pose a security risk.Israeli military prosecutors often justify the use ofsecret evidence on the basis that it comes from Palestinian collaboratorswhose lives could be endangered if the evidence were disclosed. Yet inpractice, Human Rights Watch has found, military courts do not even consideralternatives that would give the semblance of balancing such concerns againstdue process rights, such as by redaction or partial disclosure of theconfidential evidence.Israel has asserted that the Geneva Conventions of1949 allow it to detain Palestinians without charge for “imperativereasons of security.”[376] Theauthoritative commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross onthe conventions states that “such measures can only be ordered for realand imperative reasons of security; their exceptional character must bepreserved.”[377]As of December 31, 2011, Israeli authorities were holding307 Palestinians in administrative detention, up from 219 administrativedetainees at the beginning of 2011, according to the Israel Prison Service.[378]Control OrdersLegislation in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada established special mechanisms known as “control orders” or“security certificates” that have allowed detention or extremelimitations on designated suspects’ movements, communications, orlivelihoods with the aim of preventing future terrorist activity.[379] In many cases, the provisions violate fundamental rights such as freedom ofmovement, association, and expression and the right to privacy and family life.[380] Although the harshest provisions in the UK and Canada were replacedfollowing court challenges, the revised regimes remain overly restrictive:In Australia, control orders include prohibitions andrestrictions on freedom of movement, including the use of a trackingdevice; communicating or associating with specified people; usingspecified technologies such as the internet; possessing specifiedsubstances; and engaging in specified activities including those involvedin one’s occupation.[381] Australia’s Human Rights Law Centre has expressed concern that theprocess for obtaining a control order is based on secret information; issubject only to a civil standard of proof; and lacks transparency, dueprocess, and regular review.[382]In Canada, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001allowed authorities to issue “security certificates”authorizing the prolonged detention or deportation of non-citizens withoutcharge or trial, based on evidence the state could withhold from detaineesand their lawyers. The certificates were issued on “reasonablegrounds”—a lower standard of proof than used in criminallaw—and allowed the state to withhold evidence from detainees andtheir lawyers.[383] Among other sweeping provisions, a non-citizencould be subjected to a security certificate for alleged membership in aterrorist group even though membership alone was not a crime in Canadaunder the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act. The authorities used the securitycertificates to detain six Muslim men for months or years without charge startingin 2001.[384] Canada revised its security certificate regimein 2008 after the Supreme Court found that the use of secret evidence thatwas not subject to adversarial challenge was unconstitutional.[385] Theplaintiff in that case, Adil Charkaoui, was reportedly detained in partbased on secret evidence obtained under torture in Morocco.[386] Reforms to the security certificates system in2008 included the exclusion of evidence obtained through torture and other degrading treatment, aswell as the lifting of a 120-dayembargo on a detainee’s ability to apply for a release. Therevisions also allowed judges to appoint “special advocates” who could reviewand challenge secret evidence and attend hearings from which the detaineewere excluded—but who still could not discuss the evidence with thedetainees without specific judicial permission.[387]In the UK, the control orders in force from 2005 to 2011contained similar restrictions to those in Australian law, but furtherrestricted where a person could live and who was allowed entrance to theirresidence; allowed searches of their residence as well as the removal ofanything found therein; and, perhaps most seriously, required a person“to remain at or within a particular place or area (whether for aparticular period or at particular times or generally)” for periodsas long as 18 hours a day.[388] Persons subject to a control order were not allowed to know about theevidence discussed in closed hearings or to give directions to the specialadvocate appointed by the court to defend their interests.[389] After numerous court challenges, the control orders werereplaced in 2011 by the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures,which contain fewer restrictions while still imposing electronic tagging,overnight residence requirements, and limitations on association,communication, and foreign travel.[390]Malaysia’s Security Offences (Special Measures) Bill of2012, which is not yet in force, would permit the police to unilaterallyimpose electronic monitoring devices on individuals released fromdetention, a serious infringement of personal liberty.[391]AcknowledgmentsJoanne Mariner, former terrorism and counterterrorismprogram director at Human Rights Watch, researched and produced a detailedfirst draft of this report.

The legislation does provide severallimitations on these expanded police powers. Namely, a) police require writtenauthorization from the Anti-terrorism Council created by the legislation inorder to detain a person, and b) police are required to present the personimmediately upon arrest, at any time of day or night, before any judge at his orher office or residence such that the judge may inquire into the reasons fordetention and determine whether or not the person detained has been subjectedto any form of torture. On the other hand, these requirements seem only toapply to a suspect detained for a terrorist offense that has already occurred;they appear inapplicable in the case of a person detained for what is believedto be an imminent terrorist offense.[229]TheRevised Penal Code of the Philippines, Act.

We have to live here.” A lawyerexplained that he did not file a direct complaint in court of the torture hisclient had endured in part because the detainee had warned him, “If youtrouble them, they will trouble me.” Another lawyer said that his clientwas under severe police intimidation and had told him, “We have all beentortured and beaten.

For the UK, however, control orders whichcould potentially add up to a detention-like situation were enforced for thepurposes of “preventing or restricting involvement by that individual interrorism-related activity,” a very wide-ranging category extending to“the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism”but also including “conduct which gives encouragement” to specificterrorist acts or “acts of terrorism generally.” The UK’sPrevention of Terrorism Act, 2005, sec. 1.[380]In thecase of the UK, see, for example, “EU: Rights Abuse at HomeIgnored,” Human Rights Watch news release, January 22, 2012, http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/eu-rights-abuse-home-ignored;and “UK: Proposed Counterterrorism Reforms Fall Short,” HumanRights Watch news release, February 11, 2011, http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/11/uk-proposed-counterterrorism-reforms-fall-short.[381]Australia’s Criminal Code, sec. 104.5(3), as amended by the Anti-Terrorism Act, No.144 of 2005, http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00451;and Australia’s Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005.[382] Human Rights Law Centre, Review of Australia’sCounter-Terrorism and National Security Legislation, http://www.hrlc.org.au/files/HRLC-Submission-to-National-Security-Legislation-Monitor.pdf,sec. 3.6.[383] Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, ofNovember 1, 2001, http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html (accessed June 26, 2012), secs. 77-78, 81-83.
