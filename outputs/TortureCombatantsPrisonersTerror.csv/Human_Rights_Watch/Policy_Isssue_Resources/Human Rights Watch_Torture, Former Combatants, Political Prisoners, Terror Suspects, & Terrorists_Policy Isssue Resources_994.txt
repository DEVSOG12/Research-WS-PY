Introduction 
 
The practice of transferring terrorist suspects to countries that routinely practice torture 
and other ill-treatment is of growing international concern. A number of governments around the world – in particular in Europe, the Middle East and North America – have 
transferred or attempted to transfer terrorist suspects to places where they are at risk of 
being subjected to torture or ill-treatment. In the United States, the media has reported extensively on such transfers in recent months, shedding new light on a policy that remains shrouded in secrecy.

U.S. officials have been pressed to comment on the secret practice that has come to be known in the United States as extraordinary rendition. At a press conference on March 16, 2005, President George W. Bush stated that one way to protect the American people 
and their friends from future attack was “to arrest people and send them back to their

1 For a comprehensive news report, see Jane Mayer, “Out sourcing Torture: The secret history of America’s 
‘extraordinary rendition’ program”, The New Yorker , Feb. 14, 2005. Another example are the stories about the 
so-called “torture plane”—a Gulfstream jet—which has been spotted in numerous European, Middle Eastern 
and Asian countries. According to press reports and the je t’s logs, which were acquir ed by journalists, the plane 
has also landed at Guantánamo Bay. See, e.g. Dana Priest, “Jet is an Open Secret in Terror War,” Washington 
Post, December 27, 2004, p. A1; John Crewdson, “Mysterious  Jet Tied to Torture Flights: Is Shadowy Firm 
Front for CIA?” Chicago Tribune , January 8, 2005.  country o f origin with the promise t hat they won' t be tortured.”2 When asked by a 
journalist, “…what is it that Uzbek istan can do i n interrogatin g an individu al that the 
United States  can't?” the P resident d emurred, saying only that “[w]e seek assur ances that 
nobody will b e tortured when we ren der a person b ack to their home countr y.”3
 
The terms “rendition” and  “extraordina ry rendition” have been us ed to describe a 
variety of forms of trans fer of perso ns to the cust ody of other governments. It is 
important  to clarify bo th the termin ology used in this report an d the types of ac tivities 
covered. Som e of the tr ansfers of per sons suspected of terroris t activities occur within a 
legal fram ework, such a s an immigra tion deporta tion process or  extradition proceedings . 
Other tran sfers are effe ctuated outsi de of any leg al process. In many ways, t hese 
extralegal renditions rai se even more s erious conce rns, largely b ecause they ta ke place in 
secret and  without any procedural saf eguards, incl uding an op portunity for t he person to 
challenge  the transfer in  a legal forum .4   
 
While so me have used the term “ren dition” to ap ply to any tra nsfer to tortur e, more 
often “re ndition” is use d simply to si gnify the tran sfer or sendin g of a person to another 
country. “ Extraordinary rendition” typically refer s to the extral egal form of the practice, 
in which a person is ap prehended in  one country and handed o ver to anothe r without 
any forma l legal proce dure. Some dif ferentiate ex traordinary re nditions from renditions 
not based on the proce ss used to eff ectuate the tra nsfer, but on whether the end result 
involves ri sk of torture.  They use th e term “extrao rdinary rendi tion” to sign ify the 
transfer of  terror suspec ts to countri es where the y may face to rture.5   
 
Because thes e terms lack precise legal definitions, this report will use them  as follows. 
The repor t will use the term “renditi on” to refer generally to a ny transfer of a person

 2from the custody of on e governmen t to that of a nother. The ter m “extraordi nary 
rendition ” will be used to refer to tra nsfers that o ccur outside o f any legal fra mework. 
The repor t will use the term “renditi on to risk of torture” to ref er to any tra nsfer of a 
person to a country wh ere he or she is at risk of b eing tortured,  whether th e transfer is 
within or outside a lega l procedure. T his framing m aintains a cl ear focus on t he critical 
human rights  issue implica ted by these practices: the absolute prohibition on tra nsferring 
people to a risk of tortu re or ill-treatment.  Just as governments  may not engage in 
torture dir ectly, they ma y not send or  transfer pers ons to other countries wh ere they are 
at risk of torture.  
 
Maher Arar ’s case may h ave been a r endition wit hin a  lawful pr ocedure, give n that it 
appears he  was remove d from the U nited States after being pl aced in expe dited 
immigrati on proceedin gs. His case is  likely not a mong those c onsidered to b e 
“extraordi nary renditio ns” by U.S. of ficials, which  are probably limited to cas es 
involving  the apprehens ion and transf er of persons  outside of t he United St ates and 
outside of  any legal fra mework. Des pite the fact  that Mr. Arar’s r endition p urportedly 
occurred within a lega l process, it rema ins unclea r whether U. S. officials ad hered to the 
legally pr escribed proce dures in his c ase. Even if t he rules were followed, inc luding with 
respect to  diplomatic as surances fro m the receivi ng governme nt, in this cas e Syria, the 
fact that a  rendition o ccurs within a  legally prescr ibed procedur e does not a bsolve the 
sending g overnment of  its obligatio n not to transf er a person to  another cou ntry where 
he or she is at risk of t orture or ill-tr eatment. Hu man Rights Watch believ es that U.S. 
procedures  governing immigration matters, in p articular the u se of diplom atic 
assurances, are not adequate to meet U.S. obligations under the Convention Against 
Torture an d Other Cru el, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment o r Punishment , and its U.S.  
implemen ting legislatio n. 
 
As will be  demonstrate d below, sen ding a person t o a country where he or sh e is at risk 
of being s ubjected to t orture is contr ary to U.S. ob ligations und er both inter natio nal and 
domestic law.  To circum vent these legal obligations, the Bush ad ministration obtains 
diplomatic as surances fr om the receiving countr ies, stating that they will not torture the 
transferred  person. As d iscussed in d etail below,  however, diplomatic assur ances do not 
satisfy U.S . legal obliga tions because t hey do not provide an eff ective safegua rd against 
torture or other ill-treat ment. 
 
Pre 9/11 Renditions  
 
The practi ce of extraor dinary renditi ons is not a n ew phenome non. In the U nited States, 
it can be traced back at lea st to the early 1990’s, when policies were formulated for the 
 3apprehens ion and transf er of terroris t and other s uspects outsid e of any form al legal 
process. In Ju ne 1995, then-President Cli nton issued P residential D ecision Directive 
(PDD) 39, which incl udes the follo wing language:   
 
When terr orists wanted  for violatio n of U.S. law ar e at large ov erseas, 
their retur n for prosecu tion shall be a matter of the highest pr iority. … 
If we do not receive ad equate coope ration from a state that ha rbors a 
terrorist w hose extradit ion we are se eking, we sh all take appro priate 
measures to induce cooper ation. Return of suspects by force ma y be 
effected without the c ooperation of  the host gov ernment, con sistent 
with the procedures outl ined in NSD -77, which s hall remain in  effect.6
 
This polic y was reiterat ed in May 199 8 with a ne w directive, P DD-62, whic h outlined ten  
policy pr ograms, the fir st of which was “apprehe nsion, extradi tion, renditi on and 
prosecuti on.”7
 
Before Se ptember 2001,  the availab le informatio n regarding extraordinary r enditions 
strongly su ggests a focu s on deliveri ng criminal sus pects to pros ecution, par ticularly in 
the United States. During the decade prior to 1998 , the U.S. gov ernment used  
extraordinary rendition to bring 13 terr orist suspects  to the U nited States to stand trial 
on crimin al charges.8 Then FBI Direc tor Louis Free h told the S enate Judiciary  
Committe e that in the  majority of t errorist renditi ons, the Unit ed States acte d with the 
cooperation of the government in whos e jurisdiction the suspect was located.  Freeh 
described the framewor k for what h e considered a useful tool i n the FBI’s ars enal for 
bringing s uspected terr orists and cri minals to justi ce in the Uni ted States: 
 
The rendi tion process is governed by  Presidential Decision Dir ective 
(PDD) 77, which sets explicit require ments for ini tiating this m ethod for 
returning terrorists to st and trial in t he United St ates. Despite t hese 
stringent r equirements, in recent ye ars, the FBI ha s successfull y used

should be noted t hat although PD D-39 was unclas sified in 1997,  it is still heavily  redacted. NSD-77,  or National 
Securit y Directive 77 was issued in Januar y 1992 by President George H. W. Bush.  Its contents rem ain

Because of  the secretiv e nature of ext raordinary re nditions, littl e is k nown ab out the 
cases that pre-date Sep tember 11, 20 01. It is not c lear how man y other perso ns were 
rendered to the United  States for pros ecution after 19 98, and how many susp ects were 
handed o ver to other g overnments b y or with the  assistance of  the U.S. gove rnment in 
the decad e prior to Sep tember 11. Th e House-Se nate Joint In quiry into th e Sep tember 
11th attac ks claimed “d ozens” of ren ditions took place before September 11, 2001, 
although it did not spe cify how man y of those inv olved the tra nsfer of a pers on to a 
country o ther than the United States: 
 
Working with a wide arr ay of foreig n governments , CIA and FB I have 
helped de liver dozens o f suspected t errorists to ju stice. CTC 
[Countert errorist Cent er] officers re sponsible for the rendition s program 
told the J oint Inquiry th at, from 1987 to Septemb er 11, 2001, C TC was 
involved i n the renditi on of several dozen terrori sts.10
 
Accordin g to the testi mony of Geor ge J. Tenet, t he former dire ctor of centr al 
intellige nce, b efore the 9/11 Commiss ion, there w ere over 80 ca ses of extraor dinary 
rendition prior to Sept ember 11, 20 01.11 The CIA played the lea ding role in c arrying out

Several ca ses of pre 9/1 1 extraordinar y renditions to third coun tries have bee n

also know n as Abu Talal  al-Qasimi. Q assim, who was living in exile in Denm ark where 
he had be en granted p olitical asylum,  was apprehe nded in Cro atia in 1995. B efore his

U.S. Rendition Practice since 9/11 
 
Policy Changes  
Despite t he limited inf ormation abo ut pre 9/11 re nditions, it is  clear that th e U.S. 
practice o f rendition i ncreased substa ntially after September 11,  2001.16 Where as there 
were over 80 such transf ers in the y ears prior to t his date, form er governme nt officials 
estimate t hat there hav e been 100 to 150 rendition s of persons su spected of t errorist 
activities in just the thre e years since September 1 1, 2001.17 Accord ing to me dia reports, 
a few days  following the 9/ 11 attacks,  the White House issued a new directiv e, which is 
still classif ied, that gave  the C.I.A. exp ansive new a uthority to c arry out rendit ions 
without Whit e House a pproval for e ach and every case.18   
 
Renditio ns have taken place both fr om U.S. territ ory and from other countr ies, either by  
the direct seizure of for eign nationa ls on foreign territory by U .S. agents, or the transfer 
of foreig n nat ionals to t hird countrie s by the host  country auth orities facili tated  by the

Arar’s case appears to fit this new p attern. He was  never charg ed with a cri me by the 
Syrian go vernment, whi ch stated tha t it had no in terest in him a nd had not re quested his 
transfer to  their custod y for prosecuti on. On the c ontrary, senio r Syrian offi cials stated 
that the U .S. governme nt asked Syria to detain Ara r on its beha lf.25    
 
U.S. offic ials appear for  the most par t to have rel ied on their c ounterparts to  conduct 
interrogat ions and repo rt any new in formation to  them. “If we are getting e verything we 
need from  the host go vernment, the n there’s no n eed for us to [ conduct 
interrogat ions],” a form er U.S. gover nment offici al told Human Rights Watc h. “There 
are some si tuations in which the ho st governmen t can be more  effective at getting 
informati on.”26

 8other offi cials have call ed attention  to the proble m of renditio ns, more info rmation has 
been lear ned over the past year about  specific cas es. As a result, there is inc reasing 
evidence that people w ho have bee n transferred t o countries su ch as Syria, E gypt and 
Uzbekista n were torture d upon their return.  
 
One such case is that of M amdouh Habib, an Australian citizen of Egyptian origin. As 
revealed i n court docu ments filed i n federal court  in the Unit ed States, Hab ib was 
detained i n Pakistan in October 200 1 and interro gated there b y American a gents. He was  
then sent to Egypt wh ere he was tor tured in pris on for six mon ths, and the n transferred 
to the U.S . naval base at  Guantanam o.27 Habib wa s in Guantana mo for more than two 
and a half  years before he was releas ed without c harge in Janu ary of this ye ar.28 His 
allegatio ns of  torture in  Egypt are su pported by R huhel Ahmed,  Asif Iqbal a nd Shafiq 
Rasul, Briti sh nationals  who were in detention at Guantanamo a t the time o f Habib’s 
transfer th ere. Accordin g to the thre e British ex-d etainees, Hab ib was in "ca tastrophic 
shape" w hen he arrived at Guantana mo: most of h is fingernails were missing,  and while 
sleeping he re gularly bl ed from his n ose, mouth an d ears.29
 
Another r endition case  followed a si milar trajector y. In the mo nths after the September 
11th attac ks, Pakistan a pprehended a  ranking al- Qaeda leader, Ibn al-Shaikh  al-Libi, a 
Libyan na tional, and tr ansferred him  to U.S. custo dy. After a pe riod during w hich CIA 
and FBI o fficials interr ogated him, th e CIA transfer red al-Libi t o Egyptian c ustody, and 
the FBI “l ost track of h im.” After m onths in Egy ptian detenti on, a l-Libi was  handed 
back to t he U nited Stat es, and remains  in detentio n at Guantana mo Bay.30   
 
In Decem ber 2001, Sw eden expelle d two Egyptia n asylum seek ers, Ahmed A giza and 
Muhamma d al-Zari, to Egypt, wher e they were h eld incommunica do for fiv e weeks after 
their retur n.31 The Unite d States play ed a key role i n executing t his expulsion,  including

Despite m onthly visits a fter their retu rn to Egypt by Swedish di plomats, non e of them in

Abu Omar disappeared from Milan i n February 20 03, when ey ewitnesses rep orted that

 10Another v ariant of a re ndition case gained attenti on when the  parents of A hmed Omar 
Abu Ali, a U.S. citizen,  alleged that t heir son was ar rested by Sa udi authoriti es in June 
2003 whil e he was stud ying there, d etained at the  behest of U. S. authorities,  and tortured 
during his twenty mon ths in Saudi cu stody. In De cember 2004, a  U.S. court re jected the 
governme nt’s motion t o dismiss Abu Ali’s petitio n for habeas c orpus, ruling t hat it 
might hav e jurisdiction over Abu Ali’s detention in Saudi Arabia if it could be  
establishe d that the U.S . government had played a  role in his de tention by S audi 
authoritie s. The federal  court’s ruling  forced the B ush administ ration to tak e Abu Ali 
into U.S. custody and t o bring crimin al charges aga inst him in F ebruary 2005.38 More 
recently, Abu Ali filed court papers al leging that h e had been in terrogated by  FBI agents 
while in Saudi custody, that he infor med the FBI t hat he was be ing subjected to torture 
by the Sa udi authoritie s, and that th e FBI agents did not respo nd to his alle gations.39
 
Maher Arar ’s case sits al ongside thes e and other known cases of renditions to risk of 
torture. As in these cas es, Arar was tr ansferred to the custody o f a governme nt with a 
well-docu mented recor d of torture –  one amply d ocumented b y the U.S. gov ernment in 
its annual State Depart ment countr y reports on human rights. While his ren dition 
occurred following ex pedited immigration pr oceedings, the end result was mu ch the 
same. Not withstanding  the absolute prohibition on se nding per sons to places  where they 
are at risk of torture or ill-treatment, the United St ates delivered  Maher Arar t o the 
custody o f a governme nt that Presid ent George W . Bush would later criticiz e for leaving 
its people  a legacy of t orture and opp ression.40
 
These cases challenge the Bush Administra tion’s contention that its rendition policy is 
lawful and  does not exp ose people t o a risk of tort ure. Despite t he dearth of information 
about ren ditions, there  is mounting evidence tha t suspects tra nsferred to th e custody of 
other gov ernments hav e in fact suff ered torture a nd ill-treatme nt at the han ds of their 
jailers – a r esult that w as wholly pr edictable give n the poor hu man rights re cords of the 
receiving governments. These transfe rs violate th e legal obliga tion of the U nited States – 
and of an y government – not to deli ver a person t o the custod y of another s tate where 
he or she is at risk of t orture or othe r ill-treatmen t.

U.S. Legal Obligat ions 
 
The Unite d States is bo und under b oth internatio nal law and U. S. domestic l egislation 
not to se nd a person to a place wher e he or she is a t risk of tortu re. This nonrefoulement  
obligatio n is absolute, a nd admits of no exceptio n under any cir cumstances.  
 
Internatio nal Law 
Convention Against Torture  
The Unite d States sign ed the U.N. C onvention a gainst Torture and Other C ruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment o r Punishment41 (hereinafter “CAT”) in A pril 1988, 
and ratifie d the treaty i n October 1 994. U.S. rati fication was subject to ce rtain 
declaratio ns, reservatio ns, and unders tandings, including that the Conventi on was not 
self-execu ting, and ther efore required domestic im plementing l egislation to take effect.42   
 
Article 3 of the CAT es tablishes th e obligation of nonrefoulemen t in cases in which a 
person w ould be at risk of torture if s ent to a give n country. Arti cle 3(1) spec ifically 
provides t hat “no state shall expel, re turn (“refouler ”) or extradit e a person to  another 
State whe re there are su bstantial gr ounds for beli eving that h e would be in danger of 
being sub jected to tort ure.” Article 3 (2) further req uires a sendi ng governme nt to take 
into cons ideration the existence of gross, flagrant or mass violat ions of hum an rights 
when asse ssing the ris k of torture.43  
 
The Unite d States adde d an understa nding to arti cle 3 of the C AT, indicatin g tha t it

removal on CAT grounds.45  This stand ard is more r estrictive tha n the interpr etation of 
the U.N. Human Righ ts Committee.46  However, g iven that it i s framed not a s a 
reservatio n but as an un derstanding that seeks to clarify the m eaning of ter ms used in 
the CAT, the U.S. unders tanding has generally no t been viewe d as an attemp t to 
derogate f rom the nonrefou lement  obligation of arti cle 3.47 The U.S . governmen t has not 
based its c urrent rendit ion policy on  a claim that it s understandi ng of Article 3 allows it 
to transfer  persons to a r isk of tortur e in contrav ention of the  international norm, and 
therefore the understanding has not been a focus of concern regar ding current U.S. 
rendition pra ctices. 
 
The Bush Administration has recently s et out its understanding of its obliga tions under 
article 3 o f the CAT in i ts report to t he U.N. Com mittee Agai nst Torture, w hich it 
submitted on May 6, 20 05.48 After ack nowledging its nonrefoulemen t obligation,  the U.S.

Is aware o f allegations that it has tran sferred indivi duals to thir d 
countries where they h ave been tort ured. The Uni ted States d oes not 
transfer p ersons to co untries where the United St ates believes i t is 
“more lik ely than not” that they will  be tortured. T his policy ap plies to 
all compo nents of the United States government. The United St ates 
obtains ass urances, as a ppropriate, f rom the for eign governme nt to

 13transfer th e person to t he control of that governme nt unless the 
concerns were satisfact orily resolved.49
  
In the im migration  context, the U.S.  report to th e Committee Against Tortu re states that  
the U.S. government relies on assurances in a “ver y small number of cases” and only 
when doi ng so is consis tent with Art icle 3 of the CAT .50 In extrad ition cases, th e 
decision to seek assurances  is made on a  case-by-case basis.51 With re spect to tr ansfers 
from U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay, the repor t describes U.S . policy in t erms 
consisten t with the ge neral  policy ab ove, noting t hat both retur ns to risk of torture under 
the CAT a nd to persecu tion under th e Refugee Convention st andard are tak en into 
account. T he report ref ers to circums tances in whi ch the Depart ment of Def ense has 
“elected not to transfer detainees to their country of origin be cause of tortur e 
concerns. "52 This langua ge undoubtedly refers to the nearly two dozen Chinese Uighurs 
held at Gu antanamo Bay .53
 
The prohi bition on refoulement  can als o be rooted i n the notion of complicity  in torture. 
Article 4 of the CAT m akes clear th at the crime of torture enc ompasses not  only direct 
acts of tor ture, but also  participatio n and complic ity in torture.54 The concep t of 
accompli ce liability is well establishe d in U.S. dom estic law as w ell.55 In additio n, a state 
may be in breach of its international obligations b y means of kn owingly assis ting in the

 14The Inter national Cov enant on Civ il and Politica l Rights57 (hereinaf ter “ICCP R”), 
ratified b y the U.S. on J une 8, 1992, provides in ar ticle 7 that “ no one shall be subjected 
to torture or to cruel, i nhuman or de grading treat ment or puni shment.” Th is guarantee is  
nonderog able, i.e. it rem ains in full f orce even in t imes of emerg ency that th reaten the 
life of th e nation. The Human Righ ts Committee,  which mon itors impleme ntation of t he 
ICCPR b y national go vernments, has  interpreted the Conventi on’s prohibiti on on 
torture an d ill-treatmen t to include t he nonrefoulemen t obligation:  “In the view of the 
Committe e, State partie s must not ex pose individu als to the da nger of torture  or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading t reatment or p unishment up on return to another cou ntry by way 
of their e xtradition, ex pulsion or refoulement .”58    
 
Moreover, in March 200 4, the Huma n Rights Com mittee adopt ed General C omment 
No. 31 on ICCPR articl e 2 (concern ing nondiscri mination) reg arding “The Nature of the  
General L egal Obligati on Imposed o n States Parti es to the Cov enant.” Paragr aph 12 
reads:  
 
“. . . the ar ticle 2 obliga tion requiring that States Pa rties respect a nd 
ensure the Covenant rights for all persons in their  territory and all 
persons un der their co ntrol entails a n obligation not to extradit e, deport, 
expel or o therwise remo ve a person f rom their ter ritory, wher e there are 
substantial  grounds for believing tha t there is a rea l risk of irrep arable 
harm, such  as that cont emplated by articles 6 [rig ht to life] and  7 [torture 
or cruel, i nhuman or de grading treat ment] of the  Covenant, ei ther in the 
country t o which remo val is to be ef fected or in a ny country to which 
the perso n may subsequ ently be rem oved. The rel evant judicial  and 
administra tive authorities should be made aware of the need to ensure 
complian ce with the C ovenant oblig ation s in such matters.”59   
 
It is impor tant to note that such “irre parable harm, ” in accorda nce with IC CPR article 7, 
expressly i ncludes cruel, inhuman, or degrading tr eatment or p unishment.

1. U.N. Refu gee Convent ion  
The nonrefoulement  oblig ation is also a core principl e of internati onal refugee la w. The 
1951 Con vention Relat ing to the Sta tus of Refuge es and its 196 7 Protocol ( Refugee 
Conventi on) require tha t no state “s hall expel or re turn (‘refouler’ ) a refugee in  any 
manner w hatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom w ould be 
threatene d on account  of his race, re ligion, natio nality, member ship of a par ticular social 
group or p olitical opin ion.”60 The Uni ted States is a  party to the 1967 Protoco l, and has 
implemen ted its interna tional obliga tions in U.S. d omestic law t hrough the R efugee Act 
of 1980.61    
 
Unlike th e CAT and IC CPR, the pr ohibition ag ainst refoulement  under the Re fugee 
Conventi on and Protoc ol is not abso lute and exc eptions to its protections a re permitted 
in very nar row circumstances.62 Any pers on exclud ed from refuge e status or co ntinuing 
protectio n from refoulement  as a result of any one of these exce ptions, howev er, retains 
the right to claim prote ction from ret urn or transfe r to risk of t orture or ill-tr eatment

internatio nal law.

civilians o nly to states t hat are parties to the conv entio ns and wil ling to compl y with the 
protectio ns codified in  them.64 The hu manitarian la w prohibitio n of torture an d ill-
treatment covers virtual ly all persons  who may b e detained in situations of armed 
conflict, including unprivileged com batants or civ ilians who ta ke up arms. Bu t even in 
situations of armed conflict, certain hu man rights  norms, including the norm against 
torture an d ill-treatmen t as well as refoulement  to suc h abuse, cont inue to appl y because of 
their non derogable nat ure. As a result, no person i s left unprote cted at any ti me, 
regardless of nationalit y, status as a c ombatant, or the characteri zation of ho stilities. 
 
The prohi bition on tor ture and refoulement  under in ternational humanitarian l aw is 
important  to note in t he context of the U.S. globa l campaign ag ainst terrorism . President 
Bush has recently attempted to defend U.S. rendition policy based in part on an ongoing 
state of w ar. Although he claimed t he policy com plies with the  law because “ we expect 
the count ries where we send somebo dy not to tor ture”65, this asse rtion ignore s the well-
document ed records of torture by re ceiving gove rnments and  the absolute  nature of th e 
prohibiti on on refoulemen t. Even if t he Bush Admin istration wer e to claim th at Maher 
Arar, as a terr orist suspect, could be treated as an enemy combatant, it would m ake no 
differenc e with regard t o his right no t to be transfe rred to a risk of torture an d the 
concomit ant U.S. oblig ation not to t ransfer him to  a risk of tort ure. The laws of war 
prohibit tortu re and ill- treatment in a ll circumstances, including refoulement  to such abuse. 
Moreover, as noted above, regardless of a person’s sta tus under international  
humanitari an law, he or she remains protected at all times by th e internation al human 
rights law prohibition on torture and refoulement .

 17The U.N. Special Rap porteur on Tor ture has expr essed serious concern abo ut 
governme nt practices t hat are increa singly under mining the ab solute prohib ition on 
nonrefoulement  to torture.  In his report to the U.N. General Assem bly in September 2004, 
the outgo ing Special R apporteur, Th eo von Bove n, highlighte d the  problem of 
renditions  to torture an d called on g overnments t o respect thei r essential ob ligation to 
prevent a cts of torture and ill-treat ment not onl y in t heir own territory, but a lso “by not 
bringing persons under the control of other State s if there are s ubstantial gr ounds for 
believing  that they wou ld be in dang er of being su bjected to to rture.”66 More r ecently, 
the newl y-appointed S pecial Rappor teur, Manfred Nowak, expre ssed deep co ncern 
about atte mpts to circu mvent the a bsolute nature of the prohi bition on tortu re and ill-
treatment in the name of countering  terrorism, inc luding, inter alia , “returnin g suspected 
terrorists t o countries w hich are well -known for t heir systemati c torture pract ices.”67   
 
The most r ecent resolu tion of the U.N.  Commissi on on Huma n Rights on t he problem 
of torture takes a firm st and against t ransferring p ersons to pla ces where the y are at risk 
of torture.  Unlike prev ious years, th e 2005 resolut ion addresses  the nonrefoulement  
obligatio n in an operati ve paragraph in the text, a nd makes clea r that all for ms of 
transfer to  risk of tortur e are prohibi ted by intern ational standar ds. It urges st ates not to 
expel, retu rn, extradite “or in any ot her way transf er” a person t o a place wh ere he or she 
is at risk of torture.68  The re solution was co-sponso red by numer ous governme nts, 
including the United St ates and Cana da, and was u nanimously ad opted by th e U.N. 
Commissi on on Human  Rights on A pril 19, 2005.  
 
Custom ary International Law 
The prohi bition against  torture and il l-treatment h as risen to th e level of jus cogens, that is, 
a perempt ory norm of i nternational law. As such it is considere d part of the body of 
customary international  law that bi nds all states, whether or no t they have ra tified the 
treaties in  which the pr ohibition ag ainst torture is enshrined. Ma ny governme nts, human 
rights exp erts, and legal  scholars hav e also affirme d that the pr ohibition ag ainst

 18permitted,  shares its jus cogens charact er.69 The U.N. Special Rap porteur on Tor ture has 
stated tha t “The princi ple o f nonrefoulemen t is an inh erent part of the overall ab solute and 
imperativ e nature of the pr ohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. ”70  
 
The norm ag ainst tortu re, moreover, is undoubte dly one of the “basic rights of the 
human per son” that p artake of an erga omnes chara cter, that is, i t is one in w hich all states 
have a leg al interest in ensuring its p rotection.71 The erga omnes character of th e norm 
signals tha t states have a right to pur sue remedies for its violati on collectiv ely as  well as 
individual ly. Torture is a  grave breac h of the Gen eva Conventi ons, which re quire states 
parties to “search for” persons com mitting such c rimes regardle ss of their n ationality 
and bring them to justic e in their o wn courts.72 It is a c rime of un iversal jurisdic tion, and 
can also c onstitute a cri me against hu manity or a war crime und er the jurisdic tion of the 
Internati onal Criminal Cou rt.73 Implici t in such a ge neral right of  enforcement and 
remedy on  the part of t he whole int ernational co mmunity is th e principle t hat states also 
have an o bligation not to facilitate v iolations, eith er by their o wn agents or a gents of 
another st ate. Transferri ng individual s to states wh ere they are a t risk of tortur e and 
prohibited ill- treatment,  under the rationale of unr eliable diplomatic assurances, flies in 
the face of th is principl e.

 19In 1998, t he U.S. Cong ress passed le gislation tha t implemente d article 3 of the CAT. 
Section 2 242(a) of the Foreign Affairs  Reform and  Restructuring  Act of 1998  
(hereinaft er FARRA) sta tes that:  
 
It shall be  the policy of  the United St ates not to e xpel, extradite,  or 
otherwise  effect the in voluntary retur n of any per son to a coun try in 
which th ere are substant ial grounds f or believing  the person w ould be in 
danger of being subject ed to torture,  regardless of  whether th e person is 
physically  present in th e United Stat es.74
 
The polic y statement c ontained in t he FARRA larg ely repeats t he obligation under article 
3(1) of th e CAT, but its  language is note worthy. It spells out t hat the prohi bition covers 
all types of transfers, re gardless of w hether the p erson is physi cally present i n the United 
States. Th is language ca n easily supp ort the concl usion that all types of transf ers are thus 
covered b y this provisio n, including extra-territoria l renditions. In addition, t he law 
repeats th e “substantial grounds” stan dard which appears in the  CAT, and fo regoes the 
“more lik ely than not” language of th e U.S. underst anding subm itted at the ti me of its 
ratificatio n of the conv ention. 
 
The 1998 l aw also mand ates that all r elevant feder al agencies pr omulgate reg ulations to 
ensure full and effectiv e implementation of the la w.75 Regulations  are necessary to 
translate t he policy in to action and t o give guidan ce to the offi cials charged with 
implemen ting the polic y. Regulations  serve two im portant purp oses. First, the y spell out 
the proce dures that in dividuals whos e rights are a t stake may us e to challen ge their 
proposed transfer unde r the law. Se cond, they gi ve practical ef fect to the go vernment’s 
nonrefoulement  obligatio n by providing  detailed guid ance to U.S. a uthorities as t o the steps 
they must take in a case where there is a possibility of torture u pon transfer to another 
governme nt. In this wa y, regulations  help to make real the fund amental righ t against 
transfer to  torture. 
 
Only two  federal agenc ies, however, have complie d with this re quirement of the law.

The U.S. r endition pr ogram hinges on the use of diplomatic ass urances, or f ormal

widely kn own to enga ge in torture –  countries li ke Syria, Egy pt or Uzbekis tan – the Bu sh 
Administra tion justifie s the transfers by pointing  to the fact th at it has receiv ed 
diplomatic as surances fr om the receiving government.80  The U .S. governme nt grounds 
its claim t hat it can ren der suspects t o countries li ke Syria, Egy pt and Uzbeki stan without  
violating its legal obligations on the use of diplo matic assurances. It is the as surances that 
enable the U nited States to square the circle and  to claim that these renditions do not 
violate th e absolute pro hibition on r enditions to ri sk of torture.   
 
When assu rances are t horoughly an alyzed, howe ver, it is clear that they pro vide no 
justification for transfer ring suspects to countries that use tortur e. Because of their legal 
and practical failings, d iplomatic assur ances offer no safeguard a gainst torture . 
Assurances therefore d o not transfor m an illegal rendition into a lawful transfer of 
custody.

 21Obtainin g diplomatic assurances pri or to transferr ing custody o f a criminal su spect is not 
a new ph enomenon. D iplomatic ass urances have been used in  the death p enalty contex t 
for many years. The U.N . Model Tre aty on Extrad ition of 199 0,81 for exampl e, includes 
the death penalty as opt ional grounds for refusal to  extradite, un less the state requesting 
extradition su pplies sufficient assurances . The growing international trend to abolish the 
death pen alty of the las t few decades  has led gove rnments and  international  bodies to re-
evaluate e xtradition pra ctices where capital punish ment is a pos sibility.82    
 
Canada is a good exam ple of the gro wing reticenc e to extradite s uspects wit hout proper 
safeguards against possi ble executio n. As the use o f the death penalty has b ecome 
increasingly d isfavored a round the world, the need for assurances  against it in order for  
Canada to extradite a criminal suspect has grown. According to the extradition treaty 
between the U.S. and C anada, whic h was ratified in 1976, the extraditing c ountry may 
require assu rances agai nst the death penalty.83  In two c ases during  the 1990’s, Re Ng 
Extradition  and Kindler v. Canada, the S upreme Cour t of Canada held that see king 
assurances against the death penalty was  at the discretion of the ad ministrativ e branch, 
and not c onstitutionall y req uired in ev ery case.84 In 2001 , however,  the Canadia n 
Supreme Court took a s tep forward i n U.S. v. Burns , holding th at “in the abse nce of 
exceptional circumstances, which we refr ain from tr ying to anticipa te, assurances  in 
death pen alty cases are a lways consti tutionally req uired.”85 Althou gh the Burns decision 
remains pr oblematic b ecause it open ed the door t o an exceptio n, the general r ule that 
assurances are constitu tionally requir ed in death penalty cases was a  significa nt advance 
since Kindler.  
 
International bodies ha ve also address ed this issue. The Human Rights Com mittee, 
which rev iewed Canada ’s extradition of Chitat Ng , found that Canada violat ed its 
obligations u nder the ICCPR by extr aditing him to California without assurances against 
the death penalty.86 At the ti me of Ng’ s extradition,  the sole met hod of execu tion in

The Europ ean Court o f Human Rig hts (ECHR) has also addres sed the ques tion of 
assurances in extradition ca ses to cou ntries that retain the death penalty. In 19 89, the 
United Ki ngdom was ab out to extrad ite Jens Soeri ng to the U.S . state of Vir ginia, 
despite the fa ct that it had not obtained assura nces against Soer ing’s execution. The U.K. 
governme nt had secure d a commitm ent only that  its view of t he death pena lty would be 
explained to the senten cing judge. So ering, a Germa n national, applied to the  ECHR for 
relief.87   Articl e 3 of the  European C onvention H uman Rights a nd Fundamen tal 
Freedoms88 prohibits to rture and inh uman or degra ding treatme nt or punishm ent. Given 
the long wait on death r ow as well as Mr. Soering’s  age and men tal state at th e time of 
the offen se, the ECHR  found that e xtradition “ woul d expose him to a real r isk of 
treatment going beyon d the threshol d set by Arti cle 3”89 of the European Co nvention. 
 
Both the ECHR in Soering  and the H uman Rights Committee i n the case of Ng found 
that the failur e to secur e assurances a gainst the death penalty was in violation of the 
prohibiti on against ill- treatment, esta blished in arti cle 3 of the E uropean Con vention and 
article 7 o f the ICCPR r espectively.   
 
Assurances against torture versus assurances against the death penalty 
Assurances may provide an appropriate safeguar d against the dea th penalty, bu t their use 
in the co ntext of tortur e and ill-trea tment is quite different. Re gardless of o ne’s views 
about the death penalt y90 and the tren d toward worl dwide aboliti on, it is not per se a 
violation of internatio nal human rig hts law. Beca use capital p unishment re mains lawful

89 Soering , at pa ra. 111.  
90 Human Rights Watch opposes capi tal punish ment in all circumstances.  The death  penal ty is a fo rm 
of punishment unique in its cruelty an d is inevit ably carried out in an arbitrary mann er, infl icted 
primaril y on the mo st vulnerable - th e poo r, the me ntally ill, and p ersons of color. Th e intri nsic 
fallibility of all criminal  justice systems assures that ev en wh en full due pro cess of law  is resp ected, 
innocent  persons may be executed. 
 
 23in the Un ited States, it is carried out publicly and  only after th e imposition of a death 
sentence at a public tria l. A governme nt that extra dites or transf ers a criminal suspect to 
U.S. custody on the ba sis of assurances  against the d eath pena lty would know whether 
the U.S. g overnment or a state gover nment had vi olated those a ssurances at t he moment 
when it s ought the dea th penalty at  trial or when it scheduled the case for ex ecution. A 
sending st ate could pro test the viola tion of the ass urances befo re the executi on.  
 
By contras t, ensuring com pliance with a ssurances a gainst tortur e is complica ted and 
often ine ffective. Tortur e and ill-trea tment are ille gal in all circu mstances, and  
governme nts therefore attempt to hi de their illega l conduct. Ab usive govern ments that 
engage in  torture are typ ically highly  skilled at usin g torture meth ods that do not leave 
physical mark s or indica tions. The se crecy and ob fuscation th at surround the  use of 
torture ma ke it impossi ble for sendin g governmen ts to know w hether the ass urances 
have been violated – u nless the victim survives, is freed, and find s safe haven in order to 
recount h is or her exper iences. For t hese reasons,  diplomatic assurances may  be 
appropria te in the con text of extradi tion to states  that retain t he death pen alty, but they 
do not pr otect against t orture or ill-tr eatment.  
 
Diplomatic Assurances in Rendition Cases 
The Unite d States is pr ohibited und er both U.S. a nd internatio nal law from se nding a 
person to a place wher e he or she is a t risk of bein g tortured. Des pite the abs olute 
prohibition on such tra nsfers, the U. S. government has sent num erous suspects to 
countries with well-do cumented rec ords of torture  and ill-treat ment since Se ptember 11, 
2001. Som e of these re nditions have been carried out within a l egal framework , such as 
an immigr ation remova l, while oth ers have invo lved covert tr ansfers carrie d out by th e 
executive branch outsi de the law.  
 
The U.S. justifies these transfers by claiming it seeks diplomatic as surances that the 
transferred  person will  be treated hu manely and not be torture d.91  Diplomati c 
assurances are formal promises, either written or  verbal, from the receiving government 
that it wil l not subject t he transferred person to to rture or ill-tre atment. Obta ined 
through d iplomatic cha nnels, the assur ances are n ot legally binding, but are ra ther a set 
of “unders tandings” between the two govern ments. In some cases, the assur ances 
include m onitoring mecha nisms, mainly allowing the sending country’s diplomats to visit 
the transf erred person.92

While it is the stated policy of the U nited Sta tes to seek assurances against torture, 
provision for the use of  assurances is expressly pr ovided for o nly in immigra tion law.93  
The immi gration regula tions, as writt en, require th at the Attorn ey General, i n 
consultation with the Secretary of State,  verify and as sess the relia bility of a ny assurances 
obtained by the U.S. go vernment in an immigratio n case. Altho ugh the Attor ney 
General’s r esponsibilit ies appear to have shifted t o the Secretar y of Homelan d Security 
with the creation of th e new departm ent, the Att orney General would have m ade this 
assessment  in Maher Ara r’s case, whi ch predates t he creation of th e new age ncy.94   
 
The reliability assessment r equired by th e immigration regulations is completely 
discretion ary and not su bject to judi cial review.95 In extr aordinary r endition cas es, the 
State Dep artment and Central Inte lligence Agen cy (CIA) app arently are task ed with 
securing a nd evaluating  assurances.96  Wh en detain ees are release d or transferre d from 
Guantána mo Bay, the D epartment o f Defense, in  consultation  with the Stat e 
Departme nt and other government agencies, assu mes that resp onsibility.97 In no ne of 
these pro cesses does an  individual su bject to trans fer have the a bility to chal lenge the 
assurances. 
 
It is striki ng that the ex ecutive branc h and intelli gence services have sole disc retion for 
seeking, s ecuring, and determining the r eliability and sufficiency of diplomatic a ssurances 
in all inst ances. In addit ion, while it has been the traditional rol e of the courts to protect

The glarin g deficiency  in U .S. law an d policy lies precisely in th e absence of express 
provision for procedural  guarantees f or the person  subject to t ransfer, and pa rticularly 
the lack of opportunity to challenge the credibility or  reliability of diplomatic as surances 
before an independent judicial body.  Moreover , there are indica tions that assur ances are 
used to cir cumvent the  obligation ra ther than fulf ill it. As an A merican offi cial quoted in

legal requi rement, but we all know t hey do.”99   
 
Additiona lly, there are powerful argum ents agains t the use of diplomatic assur ances, 
both as a l egal matter a nd in practica l terms.  
 
Legal Insufficiency  
The nonrefoulement oblig ation is absolu te,100 meaning t hat if a risk of  torture exists then 
transfer is prohibited, and the prohi bition continu es as long as t he risk exists. As the 
Council o f Europe Co mmissioner f or Human Ri ghts Alvaro Gi l-Robles sta ted: 
 
 “The wea kness inherent in the practice  of diplomatic assurances lies in 
the fact that where there is a need for s uch assurances, there is  clearly an 
acknowle dged risk of t orture or ill-tr eatment.”101
 
Diplomatic a ssurances ar e the linchpin in the U.S.  policy of ex tralegal renditions  and 
other transfer s, since the as surances ar e the ba sis for the U.S. claim  that the person is no 
longer at r isk of torture.  In the words of President Bush: “We o perate withi n the  law, 
and we se nd people to  countries wh ere they say th ey're not goi ng to torture t he

 26people.”102 Atto rney Gen eral Alberto G onzales elab orated on this  legal argumen t in 
written re sponses to qu estions from Senators durin g his confir mation proce ss. He 
explained the Administr ation’s argum ent that assur ances convert a n illegal trans fer into a 
lawful on e: 
 
In carryin g out U.S. ob ligations und er Article 3, as subject to t he Senate 
understan ding, it is per missible in a ppropriate circ umstances to  rely on 
assurances from a country that it will not engage in torture, and  such 
assurances can provide a basis for concluding that a person is not likely 
to be tort ured if return ed to anothe r country.103       
 
However,  diplomatic as surances are not legally bi nding. They h ave no legal e ffect and 
carry no a ccountability if breached. T he person whom the assur ances aim to protect has  
no recours e if the assur ances are violated.   
 
Moreover, in the case of as surances fr om countries where the pra ctice of tortu re is 
common, assurances are  not only i nsufficient, bu t inherently u nreliable. Di plomatic 
assurances are based solely on trust that the receiv ing state will honor its wor d. Yet 
governme nts in states wher e torture is  a serious hu man rights pr oblem almost always 
deny thei r abusive pract ices. If a gov ernment routi nely violates its binding l egal 
obligatio n not to enga ge in torture, t hen there is li ttle reason to believe it wil l respect an 
unenforce able promise not to enga ge in the very s ame conduct  with respect to one 
isolated c ase.  
 
Accordin g to article 3( 2) of the CAT , sending go vernments mus t take into a ccount the 
“existenc e of a consiste nt pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violat ions of hum an rights” 
in determi ning whether  a person face s a risk of tor ture. In his S eptember 200 4 report to 
the United N ations Gener al Assembly, Theo van  Boven, the outgoing special r apporteur 
on torture , expressed co ncern that re liance on ass urances is a “ practice that  is 
increasing ly underminin g the princi ple o f nonrefoulemen t.”104 He que stioned “wh ether the 
practice o f resorting to  assurances is not becomi ng a politicall y inspired subst itute for 
the princi ple of nonrefoulement , which …is absolute a nd nonderog able.”105 In his 
conclusions, the Specia l Rapporteur s tated that, as  a baseline, in cir cumstances where a

 27person w ould be return ed to a place where torture i s systematic,  “the principl e of 
nonrefoulement  must be str ictly observed a nd diplom atic assurances should not be resorted 
to.”106 He also noted tha t if a person is  a member o f a specific g roup that is r outinely 
targeted a nd tortured, this factor must be taken into accou nt with respect to the 
nonrefoulement  obligatio n.107   
 
Neither U. S. policy no r the immigrat ion regulati ons requires th e executive b ranch to 
reject as inherently unr eliable assurances from gov ernments in countries where torture is 
a common  problem or where specif ic groups are r outinely tar geted for tortu re and ill-
treatment and a person su bject to r eturn based on as surances is a member of s uch 
group. Un der current U. S. law and p olicy, the gov ernment coul d render or r emove a 
person at high risk of t orture or ill-tr eatment base d on the sim plest and vagu est of 
guarantees .  
 
Indeed, all of the texts of diplomatic as surances collected by Human Righ ts Watch 
reiterate t he receiving coun try’s existi ng treaty obl igations as the basis for illus trating that 
they can be trusted not to torture a sp ecific indivi dual. Such pro mises from co untries 
that alrea dy routinely f lout and routi nely deny vi olating these obligations ar e meaningless  
and cann ot be relied u pon in good f aith.  
 
Arar Case 
Perhaps there is no better case to illus trate the fallacy of relying on diplomatic as surances

Syria by t he United St ates – by way of Jordan – de spite Syria’s well-documen ted record 
of torture and other ill -treatment. T he United St ates had itself  repeatedly c onde mned the 
governme nt of Syria f or its use of to rture and oth er human rig hts violation s. Arar states 
that he ha d repeatedly  expressed his fear of tortur e in Syria to U .S. authoritie s while in 
U.S. immi gration dete ntion immedia tely prior to his removal t o Syria.108   
 
Notwithst anding the obvious risk of torture in his  case, the Bus h Administra tion 
transferred  him to tortu re on the ba sis of assurances  the CIA r eportedly receiv ed from 
the Syrian  government.109  There can be no doubt that assurances from Syria a re not

 28trustworthy. The U.S. gov ernment’s reliance on Syria n assurances against tortur e is at 
best wishf ul thinking, a nd at worst t hey provide a fig leaf to co nceal U.S. co mplicity in 
Arar’s detai led allegati ons of torture and ill-treat ment at the h ands of his Syr ian jailers. 
U.S. officials themselves have not been able to ex plain the basis for trusting Syrian 
assurances against tortu re. When ask ed by a Washington Post r eporter why, given Syria’s 
widely-known record of torture, they believed Syrian assurances to be credible,  U.S. 
officials d eclined to co mment.110  Their re sponse sp eaks volumes. It is simply 
implausible to assume that a governmen t that routinely violates its binding legal 
obligatio n not to use to rture would r espect an un enforceable pr omise not to engage in 
the very sa me conduct.     
 
 Practical Inadequacy  
Practical consideration s also demons trate the fall acy of relianc e on diplomati c 
assurances, showing them  to be an ineffective sa feguard that d oes not mitigate a nd 
certainly does not neutr alize the risk of torture. Nei ther the sen ding nor the receiving 
governme nt has an inc entive to eng age in serious p ost-return m onitoring, w hich risks 
uncoverin g evidence o f violations o f their legal o bligations. At tempting to s ecure 
protectio n of a fundam ental right vi a diplomatic channels has inherent limi tations due to  
the very n ature of dipl omacy. Even i f a sending g overnment so ught to eng age in serious 
post-retur n monitorin g, torture is di fficult to de tect because g overnments t hat use 
torture are  adept at hid ing it. Moreov er, the fear o f reprisal wou ld inhibit th e detainee 
from revea ling the tort ure to any di plomat or oth er person w ho speaks to t hem in 
prison. 
 
Attorney General Albe rto R. Gonzal es acknowle dged that the  U.S. govern ment has only  
a limited capacity to enforce assurances once a person is transfe rred to the custody of 
another g overnment. I n an interview  on March 7, 2 005, the Att orney Genera l said: “we 
can't fully  control wha t that country  might do. W e obviously e xpect a count ry to whom 
we have r endered a det ainee to com ply with their  representatio ns to us. If yo u're asking 
me 'Does a  country al ways comply?' I don't have an answer to that.”111  Simila rly, CIA 
Director P orter J. Goss t old Congres s, in a hearin g of the Sen ate Select Co mmit tee on 
Intelligence on February 1 6, 2005, that “of co urse, once they'r e out of our con trol, 
there's onl y so much w e can do.”112

111 Mark Sherman, “Gonzales: U.S. won't send d etainees to countries that  tortu re, but can't ensure g ood 
treatment, ” Associated  Press  Newswires , March 7, 2005.  
112 See Priest, “CIA’s Assurances…,” Washington Post .  
 29Post-retur n monitorin g, which so me countries a dd to the assu rances, does  little to 
mitigate t he risk of tort ure. Monitori ng does not guarantee tha t torture will b e detected, 
given the  secret nature of torture. Th e perpetrators  are generall y expert at ke eping such 
abuses fro m being no ticed, and expo sing torture is  often made harder by int imidation of 
the victi ms and their f ear of reprisal s, should the y complain. As  an ineffecti ve tool to 
detect tor ture, monitori ng is not a de terrent agains t the practice  of torture. Mo reover, 
even if to rture is identi fied through monitoring, the sending st ates run the u nacceptable  
risk of bei ng able to id entify a breac h only after t orture or ill-tr eatment has a lready 
occurred.  
 
The gover nments involved  in negotiating the a ssurances have little  or no incentive to 
monitor for a nd highlight a  breach of the assurances. In some cases, sending 
governme nts want the r eceiving stat e to use prohib ited interrog ation techniq ues against 
a person t o extract inf ormation. In other cases, th e sending stat e simply wan ts the 
receiving state to take r esponsibility for warehousing a suspect who is considered a 
national s ecurity threat  in the sendin g state. Eithe r way, a sendi ng governme nt that 
discovers a  breach of the a ssurances would have to a cknowled ge a violation of its own 
nonrefoulement  obligatio n. For its part,  a receiving government th at is engagin g in torture 
obviously has little inc entiv e to allow  its human rig hts violation s to be discov ered 
through p ost-return mo nitoring. 
 
Moreover, strict monit oring sends a message of mi strust to the receiving co untry. As the 
Egyptian ambassador t o the United  States, Nabil Fahmy, said “We wouldn' t accept the 
premise th at we would make a promi se and violat e it.”113  Since a ssurances are carried 
out throug h diplomati c channels, di plomats will very often pri vilege a good  relationship 
between countries over  other conce rns, including  the human rig ht not to fac e torture. 
Inter-stat e dynamics at the diplomati c level are by their very nat ure delicate, and 
diplomats often invoke  the need for “caution” an d “discretion ” in diplomati c 
representa tions and negotiations. As a result, serious human rights  issues—ev en those 
involving  the absolute p rohibition ag ainst torture— are often su bordinated t o diplomatic 
concerns.  
 
The forme r Swedish am bassador to Egypt, Sven Linder, waited five weeks b efore 
visiting t wo Egyptian nationals wh o were denied asylum in Swe den and wer e returned to 
Egypt bas ed diplomatic as surances. T he men allege that they were tortured d uring this 
five-week  period follo wing their tran sfer to Egypt  and prior to t he Swedish 
Ambassado r’s first visit.  The Ambass ador explain ed that visitin g the men earl ier would 
                                                   
113 Ibid.  
 30have sent a signal that the Egyptians  are not trusted.114  This illustr ates that dipl omacy is 
an inappr opriate tool to ensure and enfo rce the absolute prohibition on tortu re. 
 
There is al so a profoun d lack of trans parency in t he process of s eeking and s ecuring 
assurances at a diploma tic level, often in the interest of preserving foreign relations, that 
puts the p erson subjec t to return at a serious disad vantage in t erms of chall enging the 
adequacy a nd reliabilit y of the guaran tees. For exam ple, in an O ctober 2001 st atement, 
an Assistant U.S. Depar tment of State legal adviser argued tha t seeking, securing, and 
monitoring diplomatic assurances in extradition ca ses must be d one on a strictly 
confiden tial b asis, with no public or judicial scruti ny, in order no t to undermi ne foreign 
relations a nd to reach “ acceptable a ccommodatio ns” with the requesting sta te.115  With 
respect to  diplomatic as surances agai nst torture, di plomacy alon e provides no  guarantee 
against ma ltreatment. 
 
The disin centives and p ractical diffi culties of post -return monit oring demon strate the 
flawed logic in U.S. rendition policy . In defendin g the transfer of terrorist suspects to 
countries that engage i n torture, Defe nse Departme nt General C ounsel Willi am Haynes 
stated tha t “We can as sure you that  the United St ates would ta ke steps to i nvestigate 
credible a llegations of torture and ta ke appropria te action if t here were reaso n to believe 
that those  assurances w ere not bein g honored.”116  This  policy ca nnot withstan d careful 
scrutiny. Haynes portra ys a reactive process, assert ing that the  United State s carries out 
renditions  and then sim ply waits to hear if the per son is being t ortured, with out 
explainin g how the U.S.  government would learn t hat promises from a gover nment such 
as Syria or Egypt were not being ho nored.  
 
Moreover, despite evid ence of tortur e in several r endition cas es, the Bush 
Administra tion has do ne little to in vestigate the v iolation of ass urances. Onl y in the case 
of Maher Arar has the a dministratio n tak en steps t o look into a r endition cas e, and then 
only after  Arar was rele ased and retur ned home to  Canada to re count his exp eriences in 
prison in Syria. This revi ew, howev er, was initia ted not by se nior governme nt officials i n 
response t o allegations  of torture by Mr. Arar; rathe r, it was und ertaken inde pendently 
by the In spector Gener al of the Dep artment of Homeland Se curity upon r equest by the

There is n o indication  that the U.S. government t ook any actio n to investiga te or stop 
the abuse while Mr. Arar was detaine d in Syria, or t o follow up on his allegat ions of 
torture wi th the Syrian government a fter his releas e. Moreover, while the DHS  Inspecto r 
General’s r eview is wel come for its potential to add t o what is known about Arar’s case, 
it is limite d to the cond uct of U.S. im migration of ficials and th eir decision t o remove Mr. 
Arar to Syr ia. Similarly,  Abu Ali has al leged in co urt document s that he repo rted his 
torture at the hands of his Saudi jaile rs to FBI int errogators, but  they did no t respond to 
his allegat ions.118  In short , there is no  basis for beli eving that the  stated commi tment to 
investigate and take appropriate action if  assurances were being violated is a ny more 
than emp ty rhetoric.  
 
Pending U.S. Legisla tion on Renditions to Torture 
 
In respons e to the gro wing phenom enon of ren dering terroris t suspects to  a risk of 
torture, m embers of th e U.S. Congr ess have intro duced legislat ion to put an end to the 
practice. Bills are currently pending in both the Hous e of Repr esentatives a nd the Senate 
that woul d fill the gaps in U.S. law a nd policy reg arding the nonrefoulement  obligation. In 
the House  of Represen tatives, Repre sentative Ed ward J. Markey  introduced  a bill 
entitled t he “Torture Ou tsourcing Pr evention Ac t” (hereinaft er “Markey bil l”) in 
February, 20 05,119 and in the Senate, S enator Patrick  Leahy intro duced the “Co nvention 
against To rture Implem entation Act 2005” in Marc h, 2005.120   
 
The bills a re very simila r in substanc e and scope. Both reaffir m the requirem ent to 
conduct a n individualized a ssessment of the risk of tor ture to per sons facing transfer, 
but they a dd an additio nal layer of pr otection for transfers that occur outside of an 
extraditio n proceeding or immigratio n removal pr oceeding. Th e bills require t he State 
Departme nt to develop  and maintai n a list of cou ntries where t orture is pract iced. 
Transfers t o the countr ies on the lis t are categoric ally prohibite d when they occur 
outside of  a legal proc ess in which t he person can challenge th eir transfer bas ed on a risk 
of torture.  The Secret ary of State c an waive the  prohibition by ce rtifying t hat a country 
on the lis t has “ended”  the acts of to rture that wer e the basis for its inclusion  on the list

to said co untry would not be torture d or ill-treate d. It is import ant to note t hat the bills 
sanction t he use of pos t-return mon itoring only in countries w here the Stat e Department  
certifies t hat torture is n o longer in u se. 
 
The most crucial element of the bills in putting a stop to current U.S. renditions is their 
language on diplomatic as surances. T he bills state tha t diploma tic assurances provide an 
insufficie nt basis for de termining th at a person is not at risk of torture, there by 
precludin g their use to circumvent th e nonrefoulemen t obligation.   
 
Both bills  are pending in Congress, as  of May 16, 2 005. 
 
Conclusion – The Importance of a Full Accounting 
 
We still d o not know precisely what  transpired in  the rendition  of Maher Arar  to Syria. 
While Ara r’s own acco unt provides i mportant inf ormation, the re is much tha t remains 
shrouded i n secrecy reg arding the co nduct of the governments i nvolved – n ot only the 
United St ates but also Canada, Jordan , and Syria. An official c ommission of  inquiry such 
as this on e is crucial to understanding  what happe ned in this ca se and to pre venting it 
from happ ening again. The roles of Canadian law enforcement and officials s hould be 
fully expl ored, with an eye toward un derstanding whether they played a role i n 
facilitatin g Arar’s transfe r to Syria, w hether the ass urances rece ived by the CIA from 
Syria influ enced Canada ’s response t o his impendi ng removal to  Syria, and wh at steps 
they did or did not take  to try to pre vent his transf er to Syria. 
 
Similarly, the U.S. revie w by the DH S Inspector G eneral can add  important new facts to  
the body of informatio n regarding t he handling of Arar’s case while he w as in the Unit ed 
States. In particular, th e DHS revie w has the pote ntial to shed l ight on why Arar was 
removed t o Syria and n ot Canada, a nd how and by whom tha t decision w as made. The  
review sh ould clarify whet her immigr ation offici als complied with the appli cable 
regulation s in Arar’s case,  both wit h reg ard to the processing of his removal case and 
specifically with regard to the issue of tr ansfer to r isk of torture.  Given the repor ts that 
the United States receiv ed assurances from Syr ia, it may be that the U.S. gover nment 
followed the provision in the regulations that a llows the receipt of assurances to end the 
inquiry int o the CAT cl aim and to proceed with  removal to t he country i n question.  
 
The critic al point, how ever, is not w hether the Uni ted States act ually followe d the 
applicabl e regulations. Even if Arar w as removed p ursuant to le gal immigrati on 
 33proceedin gs, the centra l question rem ains whether the regulatio ns that gover n those 
proceedings a re adequate to ensure com pliance with the CAT a nd to prevent tra nsfers to 
torture or ill treatment via immigratio n proceeding s. This is the ultimate test of any 
inquiry int o the U.S. go vernment’s h andling of th e Arar case. 
 
Human Ri ghts Watch b elieves that t he regulations  are not suffi cient to satisf y U.S. legal 
obligatio ns under the CAT. While overall they re flect a positiv e effort to cre ate 
procedures  to implem ent Article 3 of the CAT, t hey contain a  crucial structu ral flaw that  
undermine s full protec tion against refoulement . The r egulations s hould not all ow 
diplomatic as surances to end review of a CAT claim and they s hould not permit 
assurances to be used to tr ansfer a pers on to a ris k of torture. 
 
Recommendations to Ensure Comp liance w ith the Prohibition on 
Transfers to Risk of Torture 
 
To the Go vernment of  Canada: 
 
• Take all p ossible steps t o prevent tra nsfer by the U .S. or any ot her governme nt 
of a Cana dian nationa l or resident t o a risk of tor ture or ill-tre atment. Give n the 
responsibi lity of all go vernments to do everything  in their powe r to prevent a cts 
of torture,  Canada must ensure that it ha s policies in place that enable it:  (1) to 
learn abou t possible re nditions to ris k of torture o r ill-treatmen t involving 
Canadian citizens or res idents; and (2 ) to take hig h-level action  through 
diplomati c and legal ch annels to pre vent such trans fer.  
 
• Ensure tha t procedures are in place for high-level governmenta l review and  
response whenever Can adian law en forcement, im migration, or s ecurity offic ials 
learn that a Canadian n ational or resi dent in U.S. c ustody has rai sed a CAT-
related co ncern. Specif ically, if such a  person raises any concern  of torture or ill-
treatment if transferred to another c ountry, or if Canadian offi cials realize th ere 
is a risk of torture or ill- treatment, or  if the U.S. g overnment is s eeking 
assurances from another government, then the Cana dian officials must seek 
high-leve l review of th e case through a carefully de lineated pro cedure that 
involves not only law enforcement, i mmigration,  or security o fficials, but als o 
those offi cials responsi ble for asylum and refugee matters and c ompliance w ith 
Canadian international legal obligati ons. Such a pr ocess could fa cilitate actio n to 
protect t he rights of C anadians in U. S. custody. 
 
 34• Ensure full compliance with the abs olute prohibition on refoulement  in its own  
treatment of persons in  Canadian cus tody or faci ng deportati on from Cana da. 
Specifica lly, Canada sh ould prohibi t reliance upo n diplomatic assurances as a 
basis to tra nsfer any person, including non-citizen ter rorist suspects, to other  
countries when the cas e involves a ris k of torture or ill-treatme nt. Canada sh ould 
also repea l Sections 76- 87 of the Im migration and  Refugee Pro tection Act, 
providing  for the use o f security cert ificates to de tain and depo rt, based on 
secret evi dence present ed in ex parte  hearings and without proc edural guarant ees, 
persons de termined to be an immine nt danger to Canada’s securi ty, including  
potential ly effecting tr ansfers to cou ntries where a  person woul d be at risk of  
torture or ill-treatment. 
 
To the Go vernment of  the United States: 
 
• End relia nce on diplomatic assurances as a basis for concluding that a person 
can be tra nsferred to a nother countr y without ri sk of torture or other ill-
treatment.   
 
• Revise D HS regulation s implement ing U.S. obli gations under both the CA T and 
the 1998 U.S. law to en sure that the  regulations d o not permit the use of 
assurances in order to tr ansfer a person to a countr y where he or  she is at risk of 
torture or ill-treatment. Specifically, the U.S. gover nment shoul d repeal 8 C.F .R. 
§208.18(c),  which prov ides for reliance upon assur ances agains t torture to 
remove fr om U.S. territ ory persons ra ising claims under the C AT in immigra tion 
proceedin gs. 
 
• Direct the  Department  of Defense a nd the Centr al Intelligen ce Agency to 
promulgat e regulations  to implemen t Article 3 of  the CAT via p ublic notice  and 
comment procedures. E nsure that t hese regulatio ns do not per mit reliance o n 
diplomatic as surances as a basis for ending an inqu iry into a CA T claim or 
concludin g that an indi vidual may be transferred t o a place wh ere h e or she is at 
risk of tor ture or ill-tre atment.  
 
• Enact S. 6 54 (Leahy bill) a nd H.R. 9 52 (Markey bill), currently pending in the 
U.S. Senat e and House of Represent atives respecti vely, as a mea ns toward 
ending rendition to risk  of torture and en suring all relevant agencies of the U. S. 
governme nt promulgat e regulations  that comply  fully with U. S. legal obliga tions.  
 
 35To both g overnments: 
 
• Support a comprehensi ve internatio nal investigat ion of the ha ndling of Ma her 
Arar’s case by all four governments i nvolved in t his case – the  United State s, 
Canada, S yria, and Jorda n. Such inve stigation sho uld be done u nder the auspi ces 
of an appr opriate inter national body , such as the Office of the High 
Commissi oner for Huma n Rights.  
 
• Cooperat e fully and tra nsparently in their own and  in each othe r’s inquiries in to 
the Arar m atter. In part icular, the U.S . governmen t should reve rse its decisi on 
not to co operate with t he Canadian Commission of Inquiry in the Arar matte r. 
Because of ficials from b oth govern ments interact ed regarding t his case, 
including sharing infor mation, the Cana dian Com mission will not be able t o 
construct a complete pictu re of the con sequences of actions taken by Canadi an 
officials without coop eration from t he United St ates.  
 
• Comply f ully with their  respective re porting requir ements befor e the U.N. 
Committe e Against Tor ture, the Hu man Rights C ommittee, an d other relev ant 
internatio nal and regio nal monitorin g bodies. Inc lude in these  reports detail ed 
informati on about all c ases in which  requests for d iplomatic ass urances agai nst 
the risk of  torture or ill- treatment hav e been sough t or obtained  with respect to 
a person s ubject to tra nsfer to anoth er country. 
 
• Acknowle dge that the nonrefoulement obligation incl udes a prohib ition on 
transfers b oth to risk o f torture and to risk of cru el, inhuman, or degrading  
treatment or punishme nt.
