SummaryIn Turkey, manyhundreds of people currently face prosecution, or are serving substantialsentences for terrorism convictions. Their “crime” was to engage inpeaceful protest, or to throw stones or burn a tire at a protest. Legal amendments since 2005, along with case law since 2008, haveallowed courts in Turkey to convict demonstrators under the harshest terrorismlaws, by invoking two articles of the Turkish Penal Code in combination withthe Anti-Terror Law. In July 2010, as this report wasbeing finalized, the government passed legal amendments to improve the treatmentof child demonstrators; but this report focuses mainly on adult demonstrators,whose treatment remains harsh, disproportionate and ultimately violates severalhuman rights norms.The vastmajority of demonstrators currently being prosecuted under terrorism laws is Kurdish,and the laws are usually invoked in the mainly Kurdish-populated areas ofsoutheast Turkey, or in Adana and Mersin and other cities with large Kurdishpopulations. People whose writings and commentary on“the Kurdish question” in Turkey support positions perceived to besimilar to those of the outlawed armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)have long faced particularly harsh punishment under Turkish law. Now the courtsare applying the same or even harsher punishments to regular people who take tothe streets to demonstrate support for opinions the authorities perceive to besimilar to those of the PKK. While many of the prosecutions discussed in thisreport involve allegations of stone-throwing or tire-burning at demonstrations,the government’s increasingly harsh punishment of Kurdish demonstratorsdoes not appear to be a response to demonstrators’ violent acts, butrather to their perceived ideological support for the PKK. The present laws fallfoul of the standards required by human rightslaw and the rule of law that criminal offenses must be defined precisely and ina foreseeable manner (the requirement of legality).  Their application inthe manner documented in this report amounts to an arbitrary use of criminallaw in violation of international human rights standards and the rule of law.  The laws also offend against international law as theycriminalize the legitimate exercise of freedom of opinion, expression, and assembly.The imposition of aggravated punishment under theAnti-Terror Law because an individual expresses a political opinion, as opposedto the gravity of the unlawful activity, violates international human rightslaw.Official statistics are not available for the number of adultsand children convicted under terrorism laws and sentenced to prison for participatingin demonstrations, but Human Rights Watch estimates that the figure runs intomany hundreds. Anecdotal evidence from interviews with lawyers suggests thatthe numbers have been increasing in the past two years, since an importantlegal decision on the issue in 2008.Turkey’s Kurdish citizens have frequentlyprotested publicly to express frustrations with the government’s policiestowards their culture, status, and rights, and, in recent years, theimprisonment of Abdullah Öcalan, the PKK leader. For instance, on July 14,2008, and from October 18 to 21, 2008, protests were held in various cities inTurkey against Öcalan’s prison conditions and alleged ill-treatment.Protests are also held every year on February 15, the day in 1999 that Turkishauthorities captured Öcalan in Kenya and brought him to Turkey. Thefestival of Newroz/Nevruz (Kurdish and Turkish spellings in common usage inTurkey), the Kurdish New Year, on March 21, often elicits demonstrations aswell as cultural celebrations. Protests took place prior to Turkey’sMarch 29, 2009 municipal elections. There are also fairly frequent localizedprotests in cities throughout southeast Turkey and in mainly Kurdish-populateddistricts of cities such as Adana. These typically involve groups of youths andchildren, who shout pro-Öcalan and PKK slogans, burn tires in the street, andrespond to police orders to disperse by throwing stones.In the past, courts in Turkey convicted these protestors underlaws governing public order or of “making propaganda for a terroristorganization” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law). Yet inrecent years, criminal justice officials have deemed Kurdish protestorsdemonstrating against Turkey’s policies towards the Kurds to be “committingcrimes on behalf of the PKK without being a member of thatorganization” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code). As a result,they are prosecuted as if they were actually fighting the government as armed“members” of the PKK (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code). Theseserious charges, on top of more usual charges under the Law onDemonstrations and Public Assemblies, could result in sentences of 28 years inprison, or more, if there are repeated offenses. To date, the majority ofadults convicted under these laws have received prison terms of between seven and15 years. Prior to a July 2010 legal amendment, child protestors typicallyreceived prison sentences of between four and five years, though in 2010, atleast several children were sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.Law enforcement authorities and the courtsallege that the PKK and its representatives are organizing the demonstrationsas part of a wider policy to promote civil unrest, and even uprising, amongKurds in towns and cities throughout Turkey.  By way of evidence thegovernment and courts point to the PKK’s decrees issued at variouscongresses, and the fact that senior PKK representatives use sympathetic mediaoutlets to issue “appeals” to the Kurdish population to take to thestreets in protest. Hence, the template for individual indictments includes an abstractoverview of PKK history and policies, followed by a statement of the alleged specificcriminal activities of the defendant. In none of the cases examined by HumanRights Watch had prosecutors  submitted evidence to establish that theindividual defendant either heard the PKK’s “appeal” or hadbeen directly instructed or motivated by the PKK to participate in thedemonstration, much less that the individual had any other specific link withthe PKK or committed a crime under its orders.The Turkishcourts consider it no obstacle to conviction that the prosecution has failed toprovide evidence of the defendant’s specific intent to support or aid theillegal activities of the PKK. The General Penal Board of the Court ofCassation has held that it is sufficient to show that sympathetic media outletsbroadcast the PKK’s “appeals”—speeches by the PKKleadership calling on the Kurdish population to protest or raise their voiceson various issues. Then the defendant, by joining the demonstration, is assumedto have acted directly under PKK orders. Yet even at extremely localdemonstrations not announced in the media beforehand, protestors are routinelycharged with acting under the orders of the PKK. In some cases, courts haveheld that the PKK’s “appeal” to participate in demonstrationsis a continuous generic one, and therefore a specific instance of appeal to thepopulation need not be proved.This legal framework makes no distinction betweenan armed PKK combatant and a civilian demonstrator. In fact, demonstrators maybe punished more harshly, because while combatants who turn themselves in mayreceive partial amnesty under the “Effective Repentance” provisionin the Turkish Penal Code, there is no such provision to reduce the sentencesof peaceful demonstrators who have never taken up arms. As a result, peacefuldemonstrators with no clear PKK affiliation may be punished more harshly thanPKK members who have actually served as guerrilla fighters.On July 22, 2010, after civil society groups campaignedextensively against the prosecution of children under terrorism laws, theTurkish parliament adopted several amendments to limit the applicability ofsuch laws to child demonstrators. Law no. 6008, published in the OfficialGazette on July 25, 2010, states that all children will henceforth standtrial in juvenile courts, or adult courts acting as juvenile courts; childdemonstrators “who commit propaganda crimes” or resist dispersal by the police will not be charged with“committing crimes on behalf of a terrorist organization” and hence“membership in a terrorist organization” and children will not faceaggravated penalties, and may benefit from sentence postponements and similarmeasures for public order offenses.The amendments also reduce penalties for both children andadults for forcibly resisting police dispersal and offering “armedresistance,” including with stones, during demonstrations under the Lawon Demonstrations and Public Meetings.[1]Yet the new law omits any provision to prevent children from being charged with“making propaganda for a terrorist organization” (either underArticle 7/2 of the Anti-Terror Law or Article 220/8 of the Turkish Penal Code).After the law enteredinto force, courts in Adana, Diyarbakir, and Van, among other places,immediately released children who were serving prison sentences or being heldin pretrial detention on terrorism-related charges. In the coming months theCourt of Cassation is expected to overturn all convictions of childdemonstrators meted out by the adult Special Heavy Penal Courts. The SpecialHeavy Penal Court will issue decisions of non-jurisdiction for the casesagainst children and transfer the cases to the juvenile courts. Retrials willtake place in juvenile courts and, according to the new law, in most caseswhere children were convicted of “committing a crime on behalf of anorganization” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) and “membershipin an armed organization,” (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code) thejuvenile courts must drop these charges.  Most children convicted of otheroffenses (such as “propaganda for a terrorist organization”,Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) are likely to benefit from sentencepostponements.  Since this report was finalized during the judicial recesswhen no retrials had yet begun, from Fall 2010 it will be important to monitorhow the law is applied to new and ongoing cases, as well as to cases in whichthere is already a confirmed sentence.Since its foundation, the Republic ofTurkey has pursued variously assimilationist and repressive policies towards minoritygroups, especially one of the largest ones, the Kurds. Today, Turkey is home toan estimated 12 to 20 million Kurds, though there is no official tally becausethe government does not recognize the Kurds as a distinct group and populationcensuses have not collected information about ethnicity for many years. Theproblems of Kurds today have been compounded by decades of poverty,discrimination, and underdevelopment, and 25 years of displacement and armedconflict. While in the past, Kurdish language and cultural expressions werestrictly prohibited, those restrictions have eased. Yet laws and regulationsstill curtail Kurdish-language education in schools and the use of languagesother than Turkish in public life, and restrict the rights to politicalrepresentation and participation.In 2009, President Abdullah Gül andthe Justice and Development Party (AKP) government emphasized the pressing needto solve the Kurdish problem and committed to taking concrete steps to aresolution. In May 2009, President Gül commented: “Call itterrorism, call it the southeast, call it the Kurdish problem: this isTurkey’s number one problem. It must be solved … we must not missthis opportunity.” On July 29, 2009, Interior Minister Beşir Atalay indicated that a solution would be achieved “bybroadening and strengthening our citizens’ democratic rights and ensuringthat each of our citizens, wherever they live, feel themselves to be equal andfree individuals of the state.” The government named the project“the democratic opening,” though it is also known in the press asthe “Kurdish opening.” The government signaled the formal start ofthe process when it presented a plan to parliament on November 13, 2009. Amongother reforms, Minister Atalay said the government would set up a commission tocombat discrimination and end obstacles to all-day broadcasting by private televisionchannels in languages other than Turkish.  The latter step was achievedwith a regulation introduced on the same day as Minister Atalay’sannouncement.The first blow to thegovernment’s plan came in December 2009, when the Constitutional Courtbanned the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), accusing it ofseparatist activity.Then in May 2010, PKK escalated its deadly attacks onmilitary and police targets, continuing through the summer. (In mid-August2010, the organization declared an end to such attacks during the month ofRamazan.)Over the following months there were no developmentsindicating that the government was pursuing an “opening” and therewere also further serious setbacks to the process. In June 2010, 151 officialsof the now-banned DTP and its successor, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP),were indicted for membership in an alleged “Turkey Assembly” of theUnion of Kurdistan Communities (KCK), a body connected with the PKK. Those dueto stand trial in October 2010 include eight serving and four former electedmayors of municipalities in the southeast; at the time of writing this report,seven of the serving mayors had been held in pretrial detention for eightmonths. Prior to being formally indicted, 53 of the other Kurdish partyofficials, lawyers and activists among the 151 people facing trial had beenheld for over a year in pretrial detention for alleged KCK/PKK connectionsfollowing a clampdown on legal Kurdish political activity beginning in April2009 right before the government announced its “democraticopening.”Also in June 2010, eight PKK members based in PKK camps innorthern Iraq and 22 civilians from the Mahmur camp in Iraq run by the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who had returnedto Turkey apparently in response to the government’s “democraticopening,” were put on trial for “membership in the PKK,”“making propaganda for the PKK,” and “committing crimes onbehalf of the PKK.”Despite the adverse climate that had developed by June2010,Prime Minister Erdoğan repeatedly restated his commitment topursue the “democratic opening.”[2]In 2009, the government did lift restrictions on broadcasting in Kurdish, andin July 2010, it ended the prosecution of all children in adult courts andadopted amendments to limit the application of the most serious terrorism lawsto child demonstrators. However, by August 2010, the government had taken noother concrete steps to implement its plan. If the government is trulycommitted to bringing about a “democratic opening,” one importantmeasure will be to put an end to the arbitrary use of terrorism laws againstdemonstrators.In this report, Human Rights Watch examines the use ofterrorism laws to prosecute adults who protested peacefully, or who threwstones, burned tires and committed other minor acts of violence. While peoplewho commit such offenses may legitimately be prosecuted and sanctioned, thereis no evidence that the vast majority of these defendants committed any actthat would typically or reasonably be considered “terrorism.” The“terrorism” charges brought against these protestors are extremelyvague and imprecise and do not correspond to the nature or gravity of the actscommitted. As such, they fail the test of legality, and their application amountsto an arbitrary use of criminal law, and a violation of human rights and therule of law.Furthermore, it is contrary to the requirements of a fairtrial under international law for a state to impute motives to individuals andthen prosecute them solely for these assumed motives—in this case, forthe Turkish government to assume that demonstrators are acting under orders ofthe PKK - without showing any evidence of this. It is a violation of the rightto freedom of assembly for the government to infer that demonstrators havecriminal intent solely because they participated in a peaceful protest. Thereality is that in many of these cases, the demonstrators are doing nothingmore than exercising their right to freely express their views, aright that is protected under international law as one of the foundationsof a democratic society.Key RecommendationsHuman Rights Watch calls on the Turkish government, as amatter of urgent priority and as part of its stated commitment to uphold thehuman rights of Kurdish citizens of Turkey, to amend the laws that haveresulted in the punitive application of terrorism charges againstdemonstrators, notably by repealing Articles 220/6 and 220/7 of the TurkishPenal Code (“committing a crime on behalf of an organization without beinga member of that organization,” and “knowingly and willing aidingand abetting an organization”), which are punishable under Articles 314/2and 314/3 of the Turkish Penal Code (“membership in an armedorganization”), and Article 2/2 of the Anti-Terror Law,which includes a similar provision: “A person who is not a member of aterrorist organization but, commits a crime on behalf of the organization, isalso deemed to be a terrorist offender and is punished as a member of theorganization.”MethodologyThis report is based on the examination of50 cases of the prosecution of adult and child demonstrators in theDiyarbakır and Adana courts. We have focused on these two provincesbecause most of the recent prosecutions of demonstrators occurred in theseregions.Terrorism offenses and organized crime fallunder the jurisdiction of Heavy Penal Courts, which are authorized under Article250 of the Criminal Procedure Code (henceforth “Special Heavy PenalCourts,” except where referring to a specific court, such as DiyarbakırHeavy Penal Court No. 4). Crimes committed in Diyarbakır and in thesurrounding provinces of Urfa, Mardin, Batman, Şırnak, Siirt, and Bingöl are dealt with by the Diyarbakır HeavyPenal Courts. The cases in this report before the Special Heavy Penal Courts inAdana mainly concern crimes committed in the city of Adana, though the courtsalso have a remit over crimes committed in surrounding provinces, such asMersin, İçel,Gaziantep, and Hatay.The report draws on interviews with defenselawyers, prosecutors, heads of bar associations, police officers, families ofprosecuted demonstrators, defendants free from prison on bail, and representativesof children’s rights and human rights groups.This report examines 18 cases against 26individuals in greater detail to demonstrate the current practice of the courtsand reveal problems in their application of the laws.The report does not deal in any detail withthe much broader matter of comprehensively extending the limited juvenilejustice system in Turkey. In July 2010, the Turkish government amended laws toend the practice of prosecuting children under the age of 18 in Special HeavyPenal Courts and to ensure that in future, all children will stand trial injuvenile courts. The amendments also stopped prosecutors from applying the mostserious terrorism laws to child demonstrators. While these are very welcomesteps, further reforms to terrorism laws are needed to remedy the injusticesdescribed in this report.The research was carried out betweenJanuary 2009 and March 2010. Interviews with children released from prisonpending trial were carried out in Adana in May and June 2009. All interviewswere conducted in Turkish.In this report “child” and“children” are used to refer to anyone under the age of 18,consistent with usage in international law. The names of all children areabbreviated to their initials to protect their privacy. This follows thepractice of NGOs and children’s rights groups in Turkey. All adults arereferred to by their full names and not by pseudonyms.The cases in this report are up-to-date asof July 2010.II. BackgroundConflict and Kurdish Rights inSoutheast TurkeyFor the past 25 years, the Turkish militaryand the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) have been locked in conflict inthe southeast and eastern provinces of the country. The fighting has killed anestimated 44,000 people: soldiers, PKK members, and civilians.[3] During the 1990s, human rights groups documented gross violationsof human rights by both the Turkish security forces and the PKK. There werethousands of enforced disappearances and unresolved killings suspected to havebeen carried out by state perpetrators.  A state policy of burning downvillages, ostensibly to prevent them from being used as PKK bases, led to thedisplacement of 950,000 to 1.2 million people.[4] State agents conducted torture on a mass scale, and both stateforces and the PKK attacked civilians.[5]For manyyears, much of the southeast and eastern regions were governed by emergencylaws, which severely curtailed the rights to assembly, association, and expression.Fighting lessened after the 1999 capture of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan andthe PKK’s announcement of a ceasefire. Yet violence escalated again atvarious times from 2004 to mid-2010, typically taking the form of armed clashesbetween the military and the PKK in remote mountainous regions away frompopulation centers. The PKK, or groups affiliated with it, have occasionallylaunched attacks on civilian targets in cities and holiday resorts. Mostrecently, since May 2010, the PKK has carried out a series of deadly attacks onmilitary and police targets.Over the last decade, the Justice andDevelopment Party government (which has served two terms between November 2002 andthe present), and the coalition government that preceded it, undertook importantreforms to advance fundamental rights and freedoms. However, the conflict hashad a profound impact on the way legislation has been drafted in this era, andhas also influenced the way courts have interpreted laws. The lawmakers whoamended the Penal Code and Anti-Terror Law, and the courts, most notably theCourt of Cassation, have focused primarily on measures to enhance security,often at the expense of human rights.[6]The pattern of prosecutions and convictions addressed in this report is adirect legacy of the conflict: vague and overly broad laws, and harsh,potentially discriminatory, implementation of those laws by Turkey’sCourt of Cassation.While the previous AKP government (November2002-July 2007) introduced many legal reforms, countless laws continue toaffect Kurds and other minority groups disproportionately, restricting theirright to use their mother tongue in public life, to organize politically on thebasis of their ethnic or religious identities, and to enjoy other culturalrights.[7] Until recently, Turkish government and state officials viewed theKurdish question solely as about the PKK, a problem of security and territorialintegrity. They did not focus on or attempt to address the roots of theproblem. The history of minority rights in Turkey and of Kurdish rights inparticular has been extensively surveyed elsewhere, and the following sectiongives only a brief overview.Minority Rights in TurkeyTurkey is a heterogeneous country, made upof religious and ethnic minority groups including Kurds, Laz, Çerkes, Roma, Alevi, Syriacs, Arabs,Greeks, Armenians, Jews and others, alongside the Turkish majority. The Republic of Turkey has a well-documented history of variouslyassimilationist and repressive policies toward minority ethnic and religiousgroups.[8]The government has denied minority groups a full spectrum of rights, includingcultural recognition, linguistic rights, and political inclusion on the basisof ethnic or religious identity, except for three groups (Greeks, Armenians, andJews) recognized as minorities by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Throughout the87-year history of the republic, the state has refused to officially recognizeany other group as a minority.[9]The numerically largest groups to be denied recognition were Kurds andheterodox Muslim Alevis.Throughout the history of the Republic ofTurkey, Turkish citizenship and identity has been equated with membership in theTurkish and Sunni Muslim majority, and citizens have been expected to buryother ethnic or religious affiliations and associations.[10]The education system in Turkey has emphasized a single Turkish identity for allcitizens and omitted any mention of minority groups other than those originallyrecognized in 1923. People who have called for the recognition of minorityrights have often faced criminal prosecution for offenses against the integrityof the state, and their written expression has been censored. Even today, peopleare prosecuted for non-violently expressing opinions on the Kurdish issue, discussingKurdish history, and criticizing the state policy on minority rights and moregenerally discussing the recent history of minority groups.Under the influence of the Turkish left andthe Iraqi Kurdish national movement, Kurdish nationalism in Turkey began todevelop in the late 1960s, and became highly visible in the 1970s with a burgeoningnumber of cultural and political groupings. Following the September 12, 1980military coup, all Kurdish nationalist cultural and political groupings werebanned, along with leftist and rightist groups. This left the field open to theKurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – an underground group with a Marxist-Leninistorientation at that time – that launched an armed struggle against theTurkish state in 1984. From that time onwards, the Turkish military has fought thePKK, which throughout the 1980s and ‘90s sought to build a separateKurdish state. The PKK no longer advocates a separate state.  Now thegroup, still armed, fights for cultural and political rights for Kurds inTurkey.[11]In Turkey’s recent history,restrictive state policies resulted in a harsh clampdown on the civil,political, economic, social, and cultural rights of the civilian population inthe southeast.  At the height of the conflict with the PKK, this translatedinto serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Countlessjudgments by the European Court of Human Rights found Turkey responsible for extrajudicialexecutions, enforced disappearances, torture, and the destruction of propertyin the southeast provinces.[12]The failure to resolve the Kurdish questionhas been one of the main obstacles to fostering a political order in Turkeythat exhibits and adheres to the hallmarks of democracy, rule of law, andrespect for human rights propounded by human rights instruments such as theEuropean Convention on Human Rights. The European Commission has repeatedlycommented in its regular reports on the need for Turkey to sign internationalconventions on the protection of minority rights, as well as to amend itsnational laws. For years, successive Turkish governments have missed manyopportunities to tackle these issues.The AKP Government’s “DemocraticOpening” and Minority RightsIn 2009, the Turkish government indicated that it wascommitted to addressing the failures of the past. Prime Minister Recep TayyipErdoğanand President Abdullah Gül emphasized the pressing need to solve theKurdish problem and committed themselves to taking concrete steps to do so. InMay 2009, President Gül commented: “Call it terrorism, call it thesoutheast, call it the Kurdish problem: this is Turkey’s number oneproblem. It must be solved … we must not miss this opportunity.”[13]On July 29, 2009, Interior Minister Beşir Atalay announcedthat the government had begun to work on a plan to solve an issue that“we all know is vital for Turkey’s future,” emphasizing theneed for “broadening and strengthening our citizens’ democraticrights and ensuring that each of our citizens, wherever he or she lives, feelthemselves to be equal and free individuals of the state.” Atalaypromised a wide-ranging consultation process to solve what he described as“not only our party’s or our government’s problem, but aproblem of the whole society.”[14]The government named the project “the democratic opening,” thoughit also became known in the press as the “Kurdish opening.”On November 13, 2009, the government brought the Kurdish issueto the parliament for discussion. Minister Atalay promisedvarious reforms, such as establishing a commission to combat discrimination, liftingobstacles to all-day broadcasting by private channels in languages other thanTurkish, and creating a new constitution.[15] Prime MinisterErdoğandescribed the process as a “new beginning for Turkey.”The first sign of a backlash against the initiative came inDecember 2009, when the Constitutional Court banned the pro-Kurdish DemocraticSociety Party (DTP) on grounds that it promoted separatism.[16]Over the following months there were no developments indicating that thegovernment was pursuing an “opening” and there were also someserious setbacks to the process.In May 2010, the PKK escalated its deadly attacks onmilitary and police targets, in a campaign that continued through the summer.(In mid-August 2010, the organization declared an end to such attacks duringthe month of Ramazan.)In June 2010, the authorities clamped down on legalKurdish political activity, and the Diyarbakir prosecutor’s officeindicted a large group of politically active Kurds after a long investigation.[17]For more than a year, officials and activists in the DTP and its successor, thePeace and Democracy Party (BDP), and lawyers perceived to be close to the parties,had been held in pretrial detention. In June, 151 people—including eightdemocratically elected serving mayors and four former mayors of municipalitiesin the southeast—were indicted for membership in an alleged “TurkeyAssembly” of the Union of Kurdistan Communities (KCK), a body connectedwith the PKK. They are to stand trial in October 2010.[18]Seven of the serving mayors remain in pretrial detention at the writing of thisreport. The Diyarbakir prosecutor’s move to demonstrate links between theDTP and its successor the BDP, with 20 members of parliament, and the armedPKK, clearly threatens current prospects of solving the Kurdish problem bydemocratic means.Also in June 2010, eight PKK members based in PKK camps innorthern Iraq and 22 civilians from the Iraqi Mahmur camp run by the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who had returned toTurkey apparently in response to the government’s “democraticopening,” were put on trial for “membership in the PKK,”“making propaganda for the PKK,” and “committing crimes onbehalf of the PKK.”Despite the adverse climate that had developed, PrimeMinister Erdoğan repeatedly restated his commitment to resolvingthe Kurdish question.[19]In 2009, the government had lifted restrictions on broadcasting in Kurdish, andin July 2010, the government ended the prosecution of children in adult courtsand limited the application of the most serious terrorism laws to childdemonstrators. Yet by August 2010, more than a year after the interior ministerhad first promised a “democratic opening,” the government had takenno other concrete steps to implement its plan.If the government is serious about reform, among many otherconcrete steps needed, it must end the arbitrary use of terrorism laws againstdemonstrators, as permitted by a combination of the Turkish Penal Code, theAnti-Terror Law, and recent case law.III. A Culture of PoliticalProtestThe past few years have seen increasingnumbers of protests by Kurds frustrated with government policies towards theirculture, status, and rights, and towards Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisonedleader of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). For example, on July14, 2008, and from October 18 to 21, 2008, protests were held in various citiesin Turkey against the alleged ill-treatment of Öcalan and his prisonconditions.[20]Civic, cultural and political occasions regularly spur demonstrations inKurdish neighbourhoods, villages and towns. Protests are held every year tomark the anniversary of Öcalan’s capture by Turkish authorities onFebruary 15, 1999 in Kenya and his transfer to prison in Turkey.[21]The festival of Newroz/Nevruz, the Kurdish New Year, on March 21, elicits demonstrationsas well as cultural celebrations.[22]Protests took place prior to Turkey’s March 29, 2009 municipal elections.Spontaneous local protests also take place fairly frequently in citiesthroughout southeast Turkey and in mainly Kurdish-populated districts of citiessuch as Adana.  Protests typically involve groups of youths and children,who shout pro-Öcalan and PKK slogans, burn tires in the street, andrespond to police orders to disperse by throwing stones.The majority of protestors, however, are infact over 18, and are ordinary citizens making their living as storeowners,tradesmen or laborers.  Others include students, mothers running homes, ormay be unemployed. Interviews conducted with demonstrators by Human RightsWatch in Adana revealed that all interviewed were from families that had beenforcibly displaced from villages in southeast Turkey in the early 1990s, hadlost their farming-based livelihoods, and had been compelled to start anew withfew possibilities for employment. In Diyarbakır andthe other cities of the southeast, many demonstrators also share thisbackground.As the tendency toprotest Kurdish issues has increased in recent years, so has the Turkishgovernment’s drive to prosecute protestors. In the past five years, lawmakers revised theTurkish Penal Code and the Anti-Terror Law to more broadly cover protest.Judicial precedents have established an even broader basis for the prosecutionof protestors. Now, Kurdish demonstrators routinely face prosecution and longprison terms. Kurdish party officials and others who make speeches on theKurdish question or some journalists writing on it and in particular expressingopinions that are ideologically similar, or perceived to be similar, toopinions of the PKK, may also face prosecution under the same combination oflaws.  Although the statisticalpicture is incomplete, research by Human Rights Watch indicates that many hundreds of individuals arecurrently being prosecuted under harsh anti-terror laws merely forparticipating in demonstrations on Kurdish issues or for speeches and writings.Our focus in this report is ondemonstrators rather than on the individuals prosecuted for speeches andwritings. A clear pattern has emerged: Police arrest demonstrators on thegrounds that they have taken part in unauthorized demonstrations, accusing themof shouting pro-PKK slogans, waving pro-PKK banners, and resisting policedispersal by throwing stones. Police and prosecutors also identify statementsfrom the websites and satellite TV broadcasts of news outlets sympathetic tothe PKK to demonstrate that the PKK has issued “appeals” to thepeople to participate in demonstrations centered on particular themes onparticular days. The demonstrators are then charged and sentenced as though theyare armed members of the PKK. Up until now, a significant proportion of thedemonstrators treated in this manner have been children, typically aged 15 to17, but some as young as 12. Legal amendments passed in July 2010 improvedtheir situation, mandating that they be tried in juvenile courts only, andexempting them from prosecution as armed militants for most offenses. Humanrights groups will closely monitor the implementation of the new law in thecoming months.Violations of and limitations on freedom ofexpression in Turkey have been well-documented.[23] Yet in the past, most of those who faced prosecution for making criticalstatements on the Kurdish question, on minority rights, and on Turkish statepolicies, have been more or less prominent individuals—mayors and otherpolitical officials, writers, publishers, journalists, and other public figures—orpublishing houses and media outlets. In contrast, this report focuses on ordinarycitizens who join demonstrations and face prosecution for shouting slogans orholding up banners, and for exercising their right to assembly; their casesrarely garner public attention or press coverage. And while civil society groupsin Turkey have campaigned against the prosecution of child demonstrators, therehas been much less attention paid to adult demonstrators and the legal changesthat in the past several years have fostered a disturbing new pattern ofconvictions.Lawenforcement officials, public prosecutors, and courts claim that thesedemonstrations are organized by the PKK and its representatives as part of awider policy to promote civil disobedience and even uprising among Kurds.Police officers interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated that recently morechildren were participating in demonstrations, and expressed their belief thatthese children—as well as adults—were being organized byrepresentatives of the PKK, down to details such as where they stand in thedemonstrations.[24]Similarly, in a 2009 statement to the Committee onthe Rights of the Child, the Turkish government wrote that the PKK and groupslinked to it have stressed “the necessity of spreading violence, massriots and protests to cities and urban areas by using particularly women andchildren” and have exploited the youth “either by force or by moneyor through false promises in order to create mass violence.”[25]Yet most of the demonstrators facing prosecutionare over 18 years old, and Human Rights Watch has seen police reports thatregularly blame adult demonstrators for directing resistance to the police.Publicprosecutors seem to share this view of Kurdish protestors’ motivationsfor demonstrating. Indeed, most indictments state that the demonstrations arepart of a PKK policy of protest. The indictments detail the formalization ofthe PKK policy in a series of decrees the organization issued at variouscongresses, and state that senior representatives of the PKK use sympatheticmedia channels to issue their calls to Kurdish supporters to take to thestreets in protest. Individual indictments thus include an abstract overview ofelements of the history of the PKK and its policies, followed by a statement ofthe alleged specific criminal activities of the defendant. Typically,prosecutors submit no evidence that would establish that the individualdefendant either heard the PKK’s “appeal” or was directlyinstructed or motivated to participate in the demonstration by the PKK, muchless evidence that the defendant had any specific link to the PKK or committeda crime under its orders.The Turkish courts do not view the prosecution’sfailure to provide evidence of the defendant’s specific intent to supportor aid the illegal activities of the PKK as any obstacle to conviction. TheGeneral Penal Board of the Court of Cassation has held that it is sufficient toshow that sympathetic media outlets broadcast PKK “appeals,” speechesby the PKK leadership to the Kurdish people. Then the court assumes that anydemonstrator went out to protest in direct response to the PKK’s“appeals,” under PKK orders—whether or not that particulardemonstrator ever heard them. Even in cases involving extremely local demonstrationsthat no media outlet announces beforehand, protestors are routinely chargedwith acting under the orders of the PKK. Courts in Adana, for example, havejustified convicting child defendants of “committing a crime on behalf ofthe PKK” by claiming that the PKK’s “appeal” toparticipate in demonstrations is a continuous one, and therefore does notrequire a specific address about a particular occasion.This legal framework makes no distinction betweenan armed PKK fighter and a civilian demonstrator. In fact, a loophole can leadto harsher punishments for demonstrators than for fighters: the “EffectiveRepentance” law (Article 221, Turkish Penal Code) provides for a partialamnesty for onetime fighters who turn themselves in, but there is no suchprovision for peaceful demonstrators who have never taken up arms. As a result,such demonstrators can be sentenced to prison terms for membership in aterrorist organization without the possibility of a reduced sentence or droppedcharges available to others who have actually taken up arms on behalf of thePKK. These serious charges, added to charges under the Law onDemonstrations and Public Assemblies, could result in prison sentences forprotestors of 28 years or even higher. To date, the majority of adults prosecutedunder these laws have received prison terms of between seven and 15 years,since courts dealing with these cases have generally not opted to applysentences at the upper end of the sentence range. Child protestors havetypically received prison sentences of between four and five years, though in2010, at least several children were sentenced to seven-and-a-half-year prisonterms.The laws are discussed in full in the nextchapter, followed by a discussion of the case law.IV. Terrorism laws and DemonstratorsIn 2004, when the Justice and DevelopmentParty (AKP) government began to revise the Turkish Penal Code, many observershoped for broad legal change as part of Turkey’s bid for full EuropeanUnion membership and more importantly to benefit all citizens of Turkey.Yet in 2005, when the new Penal Code was passed into law, it containedimportant improvements in some areas (for example, in the provisions relatingto the prosecution of violence against women, and the definition of the crimeof torture and its prosecution). Yet in other areas, the new code fell short ofexpectations: restrictions on freedom of expression remained, and crimes deemedterrorist offenses were vaguely worded and lacked the clarity required incriminal law. Then in 2006, lawmakers passed amendments to the Anti-Terror Lawthat broadened its applicability, with particularly serious consequences forjuveniles. And in 2008, the highest chamber of Turkey’s court of appeal(the Court of Cassation) issued a precedent ruling which pointed the way to theharsh and arbitrary application of vaguely worded provisions in the 2005 PenalCode to those involved in demonstrations.Below, we review the application of twoarticles of the new Penal Code (Articles 220 and 314) to demonstrators onKurdish issues, and also consider the impact of the new Anti-Terror Law of 2006and the case law that since 2008 has allowed demonstrators to be sentenced tolong prison terms as “terrorists” for activities such as shoutingslogans, making victory signs, holding up banners, and throwing stones. We alsoreview July 2010 amendments to the Anti-Terror Law that have ameliorated thesituation of child demonstrators, but have not improved the prospects ofadults, or addressed the problems in the Penal Code.Terrorism Offenses in the 2005Turkish Penal Code and the 2006 Revisions to the Anti-Terror LawDomestic and international nongovernmentalorganizations have frequently criticized Turkey’s laws on terrorismoffenses. Courts have too often deemed nonviolent expression to be terroristpropaganda or to constitute aiding and abetting a terrorist organization.Courts have deemed individuals to be “members” of armedorganizations on notoriously vague grounds. It was therefore particularlyregrettable to discover that the legal reforms introduced with the 2004revision of the Turkish Penal Code, which went into effect on June 1, 2005, didnot sufficiently remedy the situation. Our focus here is the laws that have establisheda basis for the problematic prosecution of demonstrators and for the highcriminal sentences available and imposed in such cases. Defendants are alsocharged under previously existing laws, such as being in violation of the Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetings (Lawno. 2911), which outlines more standard offenses related to demonstrations,such as “resistance to police dispersal,” and the grounds on whichdemonstrations can be restricted and therefore deemed unauthorized.The 2005 Penal Code introduced Article 220,entitled, “Forming Organized Groups with the Intention of Committing Crime”(See translation, appendix 1). This article has been most commonly used topunish criminal gangs, as a separate article, discussed below, criminalizesmembership in armed political organizations. However, courts have also appliedArticle 220 to those deemed to be associated with armed politicalorganizations.This article also introduced a provisionallowing individuals to be treated as if they are members of an armed organizationeven if they are not. Paragraph 6 of Article 220 states:A person who commits a crime on behalf ofthe organization although he or she is not a member of the organization[emphasis added] shall also be punished as though a member of the organization.Thus, individuals who “commit crimes onbehalf of” armed organizations such as the PKK can be prosecuted as ifthey were fighters, and sentenced accordingly.Similarly, Article 220/7 states:A person who aids and abets theorganization knowingly and willingly, although he or she does not belong to thehierarchical structure of the organization, shall be punished as though amember of the organization.While Article 220/7 has not recently beenapplied to pro-Kurdish demonstrators, it has in some cases been applied toleftist demonstrators who have been punished as “members” of armedorganizations for “knowingly and willingly aiding” them without providingany material assistance.[26]This undefined and vague charge currently in use against leftist demonstratorsdeserves a separate study.Article 220/6-7 of the Penal Code connectswith Article 2/2 of the Anti-Terror Law, which includes a similar provision:A person who is not a member of aterrorist organization, but commits a crime on behalf of the organization, isalso deemed to be a terrorist offender and is punished as a member of theorganization.[27]Finally article 220/8 penalizes“propaganda,” and its use frequently constitutes a restriction onfree expression:A person whomakes propaganda for the organization or its objectives shall be punished toimprisonment of one to three years. If the crime is committed through media andpress, the sentence will be increased by half.When a defendant is convicted of committinga crime on behalf of an armed political organization, Article 314 of the PenalCode provides the punishment, stipulating substantially higher penalties thanif the person were prosecuted for a crime committed on behalf of an organizedcriminal gang.Article 314/2 applies to any person whoestablishes or becomes a member of an armed political organization (seetranslation, appendix 1). Article 314/3 states vaguely:Other provisions relating to the offenseof forming an organized group for the purpose of committing crimes are treated[punished] in the same way as for this offense.This paragraph, and Anti-Terror Law Article2/2 (above) provide the legal basis for linking the offenses proscribed by Article220 (e.g., 220/6, participation in political demonstrations) with the harshpunishments provided for in Article 314.Thecharge of “membership in an armed political organization” underArticle 314/2 of the Penal Code carries a five-to-10-year prison sentence. Thenthe Anti-Terror Law bears on the case, and its Article 5 provides that thesentence automatically increases by one-half, because the crime is also aterrorism offense. Any crime committed “on behalf of” the PKK fallsunder Article 5 of the Anti-Terror Law because the PKK is a terroristorganization under Turkish law.To date, adult demonstrators convictedunder Articles 220 and 314 have typically been sentenced to between seven and15 years in prison after discretionary reductions are applied.[28] In addition to the charge of “membership in an armedorganization” for “committing a crime on behalf of anorganization,” the defendant also faces other charges for being inviolation of the Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetings.[29]The combination of charges, in theory, means that a defendant could face 28years’ imprisonment or more, and an even higher sentence if there aremultiple violations, and the court were to opt to sentence at the upper end ofthe range.[30]In July 2006, the Turkish parliament passed a series ofamendments to the 1991 Anti-Terror Law.  Of relevance here is theamendment to Article 7/2 concerning the crime of “making propaganda for aterrorist organization,” so it could be applied more directly todemonstrators and others committing an offense by means of a speech, in writingor over a broadcast (see Appendix 1 for a full translation of article 7). Thisprovision is widely used in Turkey today to restrict nonviolent expression onthe Kurdish issue, as well as to prosecute nonviolent expression by individualsassociated with legal leftist organizations that share ideological ground withillegal armed leftist groups. The widespread use of Article 7/2 to restrict leftistnonviolent expression merits a separate study, but the cases included in thisreport demonstrate that this charge of “making propaganda” is now invariablyused against Kurdish demonstrators, along with the more serious charge of“committing a crime on behalf of the PKK.”[31]Revisions to the Anti-Terror Law in 2006had particularly serious implications for children. Under the 2006 amendments,children between 15 and 17 years of age charged with a terrorist offense forfeitedthe right to be tried in juvenile courts (Article 9, Anti-Terror Law).Instead, they were now to be tried in Special Heavy Penal Courts establishedunder Article 250 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which have a special remit todeal with terrorism and organized crime cases.[32]The Case Law on Articles 220/6 and314/2-3: The Felat Özer CaseThe provisions discussed above build acomplicated and interlinked set of legal norms applicable to demonstrators, andpotentially also to anyone else deemed to have committed a crime “onbehalf of” an illegal organization. They do not, however, explain howparticipation in a demonstration, without any further action, can be sufficientto warrant the charge of committing a crime on behalf of the PKK, and, byextension, of membership in the PKK. To understand how Turkish courts today areable to apply these laws to demonstrators, it is necessary to review thereasoning of the General Criminal Board of the Court of Cassation in a 2008precedent-setting decision.[33] In the Felat Özer case, the Court of Cassation held that bythe sole fact of joining protests, demonstrators were committing crimes“on behalf of the PKK.” The court reasoned that because the PKKregularly issues “appeals” through sympathetic media outlets to theKurdish people to join protests, any demonstrator attending a protest must be actingunder PKK orders. This ruling led other courts to apply the vaguely worded lawsdiscussed above to demonstrators.The Özer case involved a demonstratorwho was convicted of violent activities during mass protests that took place inthe city of Diyarbakır on March 28 to 31, 2006, as well as for his conductduring two other demonstrations which he participated in at around the sametime. The March 2006 protests merit a brief account here because they promptedthe legal changes that have resulted in the prosecution of and severe penaltiesfor demonstrators that are the subject of this report. Following the March 2006demonstrations, the government also quickly introduced revisions to theAnti-Terror Law.Background to the Özer Case:The Diyarbakir Protests of March 28 to 30, 2006On March 24, 2006, the military killed 14members of the PKK in the Şenyayla region, a rural area between Diyarbakır, Bingöl,and Muş. The PKK subsequentlymade unsubstantiated claims that the group had been attacked by some form ofchemical weaponry, leaving their bodies burnt and unrecognizable.  Afterautopsies in Malatya, the bodies of four of the militants were released totheir families in Diyarbakir, amid public outrage about the alleged use ofchemical weaponry. On March 28, a funeral ceremony for the four took place inDiyarbakır. A satellite news channel sympathetic to the PKK had reportedlyencouraged popular participation in the funeral.[34]At any rate, the crowd assembled for the funeral grew large, and after thefuneral prayers, clashes erupted between demonstrators and the police, andspread to different neighbourhoods. The protests assumed a scale not previouslyencountered in many years, and went on for days. In the course of thedemonstrations, 10 individuals were killed, eight of them by bullets suspectedto have been fired by the security forces. Local human rights groups and theDiyarbakır Bar Association believe that the use of excessive force topolice the demonstrations exacerbated tensions and caused the demonstrations tocontinue longer.[35]Hundreds of demonstrators and members ofthe security forces were reportedly injured during the protests. Hundreds ofpeople—many of them children—were detained. Many of the detainees,including many children, reported ill-treatment in police custody. These claimswere documented at the time by local human rights NGOs, the Diyarbakır BarAssociation, and Amnesty International.[36] Todate, not a single allegation of ill-treatment or use of excessive force bypolice has resulted in a disciplinary sanction against a police officer, farless any criminal prosecution. In all but one case, the separate investigationsinto the fatal shootings have still not been concluded after more than fouryears.[37]After the demonstrations, hundreds ofadults and children were tried for terrorism offenses, as well as fordamagingpublic property, for various violations of the Law on Demonstrations and PublicAssemblies (resisting dispersal, joining unauthorized demonstrations, etc.),and also for looting. The courts generally convicted the demonstrators of anoffense under  Article 7/2 of the Anti-Terror Law (“makingpropaganda for a terrorist organization”), violating the Law onDemonstrations and Public Assemblies, and, where there was enough evidence,“damaging public property” (Articles 151-52, Turkish Penal Code).The General Criminal Board of theCourt of Cassation Decision in the Özer CaseIn March 2006, as Diyarbakır eruptedin protest, Felat Özer was working there as a barber. Özer wasaccused of involvement in violent acts at the March 28 protest and two otherdemonstrations around that time. The main evidence cited against Özer inthe reasoned verdict of the court  consisted of video footage of him atvarious demonstrations: Özer carrying an empty coffin and shouting slogansat the funeral of a PKK member on February 26, 2006; Özer at the front ofa group of protestors at a Newroz demonstration, gesticulating to the others withhis hands, which the court determined amounted to directing the resistance tothe police; and Özer shouting slogans among a group of people burningtires during the March 28 Diyarbakır protests, and partly covering hisface with a red scarf to conceal his identity. There was apparently no videoevidence of Özer actually throwing stones or resorting to violencehimself, only a photograph of him with a stone in his hand, and evidence thathe had been among a group that violently resisted the police. On the basis ofthis evidence, on September 29, 2006, Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4convicted Özer of resisting dispersal by the police in violation of theLaw on Public Meetings and Demonstrations, and of making propaganda for the PKK(Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law).Özer’s lawyer and the prosecutorboth lodged an appeal against the sentence with the Ninth Penal Chamber of theCourt of Cassation.[38]In a February 21, 2007 ruling, the NinthChamber held that the Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court should have tried andconvicted Özer under different articles of the Penal Code, and thatÖzer had in fact committed a crime on behalf of the PKK and could havebeen punished as a member of the armed organization (Articles 220/6 and314/2-3, Turkish Penal Code). The Ninth Chamber reasoned that the PKK hadordered all the demonstrations Özer had participated in, and that he wastherefore acting under the PKK’s orders.TheDiyarbakır court retried Özer, but rejected the view of the NinthChamber of the Court of Cassation that Özer should have been charged withcommitting a crime on behalf of the PKK. Arguing that the defendant had notaided the organization directly, on May 31, 2007, the Diyarbakir court returnedthe same verdict as it had in September 2006 that Özer had violated theLaw on Demonstrations and Public Meetings and had made propaganda for thePKK.The Diyarbakır court had reasoned:In our view, the issue aimed at in Article220/6 of Turkish Penal Code No. 5237 is to ensure punishment of individualscommitting crimes on behalf of an organization as subcontractors of theorganization, and to punish both the crimes committed and the individual as amember of an organization in whose name crimes have been committed. Forexample, individuals have committed a crime on behalf of an organization ifthey commit crimes such as bombings, murders and holdups, and moreover, it isnatural for them to be punished as members of theorganization.In contrast with this, in cases wherepeople participate in the funerals of members of a terrorist organization or inNevruz celebrations, after the abstract and generalized appeal of thatorganization, and in cases where shouting slogans constitutes propaganda for anorganization, it is not possible to say that crimes were committed on behalfof  the organization. In order for the court to say that a crime has beencommitted on behalf of an organization, the organization must have appealed foraction not to an undefined collective, but rather to an individual capable ofdirectly carrying out an action.[39]Because of the disagreement between thelocal Diyarbakır court and the Ninth Penal Chamber of the Court ofCassation, the case was referred to the General Penal Board of the Court ofCassation. The decision of the board produced the definitive judgement on thematter and established the case law that is binding on courts hearingcomparable cases.The General Penal Board agreed with theNinth Chamber that individuals who join mass demonstrations for which there hadbeen an “appeal” to participate by an armed group are acting underthe orders of the armed group. The court reasoned that:An organization’sgeneral “appeal” [for participation in a demonstration] is madeconcrete through broadcasts from broadcasting organs belonging to theorganization, and there is no need for such appeals to be made to an identifiedindividual person. It is established that the actions carried out on behalf ofthe organization are realized under the knowledge and at the wish of theorganization. An action by a defendant who joins these demonstrations carriedout on behalf of the organization constitutes a violation of Turkish Penal CodeArticle 314/2 indicated by Articles 314/3 and 220/6.[40]In determining that demonstrators wereresponding to PKK orders to protest, the General Penal Board described atlength PKK policies to promote a campaign of civil unrest (in Kurdish, serhildan)among the general Kurdish population. The board said that the PKK had organizeduniversity students, parents of schoolchildren, and civil society groups topetition for Kurdish-language education, and had also organized campaigns toappeal for a general amnesty for PKK members, a ceasefire, and the release fromprison of Abdullah Öcalan.[41]After the General Penal Board’s decision in the Özer case, manysubsequent indictments against those charged with “membership in an armedorganization” and “committing a crime on behalf of an organization,”have referred to these PKK resolutions as though they prove that variousdefendants have acted under PKK orders.The Diyarbakır court had reasoned thata person could not be convicted of “committing a crime on behalf of thePKK,” unless the organization directly ordered that individual to act,rather than issuing a generalized appeal to an “undefinedcollective.” Yet the General Penal Board held the opposite, that a generalized“appeal” was sufficient to prove the crime.  Subsequent to theGeneral Penal Board’s ruling, indictments have typically includedstatements from the PKK and its leadership aired on sympathetic news websitesand television channels as evidence of such “appeals,” withoutattempting to prove a link between individual demonstrators and  suchmaterial, much less the PKK itself.Ultimately, on December 16, 2008, theDiyarbakır court convicted Felat Özer in a second retrial of“committing a crime on behalf of the PKK,” and also of“membership in an armed organization,” “making propaganda forthe PKK,” and three counts of violating the Law on Demonstrations andPublic Assemblies (Law no. 2911) for “using force or violence or threatsor attacks or resistance during the dispersal of a demonstration” (Article32/c, Law no. 2911).[42]Özer was sentenced to 14 years and seven months in prison. The Court ofCassation upheld the sentence on all counts but one on November 11, 2009.[43]The Diyarbakır Bar Association has criticized the useof Article 220 of the Turkish Penal Code that has emerged since the Özerprecedent, noting “the extremely vague and wide definitions in the lawthat have opened the way to such an interpretation” by the Court ofCassation. The bar association concluded that the article violatesthe principles of legality and legal certainty because it is too broad andvague to meet requirements in criminal law for precision and clarity. Suggestingthat the article also violates the fair trial principle and the principle ofproportionality between crime and punishment, the bar association recommendedthat Article 220 be amended, commenting:It openly runs against the terms of a democratic society fora person who has no direct connections with an organization to be prosecuted, andpotentially sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, solely because thatperson joined a mass demonstration and shouted a slogan or threw a stone.[44]A combination of vague language in the Penal Code (Article220/6-7)  and the Anti-Terror Law (Article 2/2) and the harsh ruling inthe Özer case has resulted in a new pattern ofprosecutions and convictions, which we show in Chapters 5 to 7of this report.[45]Legal Amendments in July 2010Concerning Child DemonstratorsThe prosecution of children under terrorismlaws rose over the period 2006 to 2010, with a significant rise in the numberof prosecutions in 2008 (the last available official statistics). In 2006,legal proceedings under the Anti-Terror Law against 299 children were initiatedin that year; in 2007 the figure rose to 438 children, and in 2008 this rose tolegal proceedings initiated against 571 children.Of these 571 children, 306 were chargedwith membership in an armed organization, an offense in the penal code that isalso simultaneously punishable under the Anti-Terror Law. It is probable thatthe other 265 children were prosecuted primarily under article 7/2 of theAnti-Terror Law (“propaganda for a terrorist organization”).In response to the rising number ofprosecutions revealed in these figures, throughout 2009, local civil society groupscampaigned extensively against the treatment of children (whom the press dubbed“the children who throw stones”) under the Anti-Terror Law  (thoughit was not the Anti-Terror Law alone that led to their extensive convictionsand harsh sentencing). A signature-based campaign called “Those Who Callfor Justice for Children” (Çocukiçin Adalet Çağırıcıları) was a leading force, andthose involved advocated concertedly and regularlyacross parties, launching a huge media campaign to press for the repeal ofrelevant articles of the Anti-Terror Law and an end to the use of terrorismlaws and articles of the Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetings againstchildren.[46]In 2009, the UnitedNations Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern that 2006amendments to the Anti-Terror Law “allow for the prosecution of childrenabove 15 years as adults in Special Heavy Penal Courts.”[47]The committee expressed particular concern “over reports indicating theapplication of the ATA [Anti-Terror Act, i.e. Anti-Terror Law] on grounds suchas the presence or participation in demonstrations and publicgatherings.”The committee made a number of recommendations, includingthat the Turkish government amend the Anti-Terror Law “to ensure thatchildren are not tried as adults in Special Heavy Penal Courts” and thatthey be “guaranteed the protection of juvenile justice standards inordinary courts….” The committee also called on Turkey to ensure “thatchildren are only detained as a measure of last resort and for the shortestpossible time period,” and to afford children a number of otherprocedural protections.[48]The government started and then stopped itsefforts to change laws and practices related to children. In September 2009,following enormous public pressure, and just before the Committee on the Rightsof the Child was to publish its conclusions, the government announced that itwould repeal several provisions of the Anti-Terror Law and ensure that allthose under 18 years of age would again be tried in juvenile courts.[49]Children who received sentences of less than two years would be eligible to receivea suspended sentence and those aged 15 to 17 could benefit from greater discretionarysentence reductions.[50] Yet the government shelved the amendments in December 2009, mostlikely in reaction to the death of seven soldiers in a December 8 PKK attack inTokat province.In June 2010, Minister of Justice SadullahErgin stated that there were 206 children in prison in Turkey convicted of, orstanding trial for, terrorist offenses, and that there was a total of 2,506children in prison for all offenses.[51] However, the campaign for change continued, in March 2010 thegovernment revived the plan, and on July 22, 2010, the Turkish parliamentadopted several amendments to ensure that in futurechildren will only stand trial in the juvenile justice system.The positive aspects of the “LawAmending the Anti-Terror Law and other Laws” (Law no. 6008),published in the Official Gazette on July 25, 2010, include thefollowing provisions: all children will henceforth stand trial in juvenilecourts, or adult courts acting as juvenile courts; child demonstrators who commit“propaganda crimes” or resist police dispersal will not be chargedwith “committing crimes on behalf of a terrorist organization”(Article 2/2, Anti-Terror Law); and children will not face aggravated penaltiesand may benefit from sentence postponements and similar measures for publicorder offenses. The amendments also reduce penalties for both children andadults under the Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetings for forciblyresisting police dispersal and offering “armed resistance,”including with stones, during demonstrations.[52]Yet the new law omits any provision to prevent children frombeing charged with terrorism propaganda offenses (either under Article 7/2 ofthe Anti-Terror Law or Article 220/8 of the Turkish Penal Code).The new law also failed to state directly thatTurkish Penal  Code Articles 220/6-7 (“committing a crime on behalfof an organization” and “aiding and abetting an organizationknowingly and willingly”) used in conjunction with  Article 314(“membership in an armed organization”)  would not be appliedto children. Instead, the amendment focused on the non-applicability of Article2/2 of the Anti-Terror Law in cases of children who had committed“propaganda crimes” or had resisted police dispersal.  Asstated earlier, Article 2/2 of the Anti-Terror Law states: “A person whois not a member of a terrorist organization, but commits a crime on behalf ofan organization, is also deemed to be a terrorist offender and is punished as amember of the organization.”[53] This article connects directly with Turkish Penal Code Article220/6 (“A person who commits a crime on behalf of the organization althoughhe is not a member of the organization shall also be punished as though amember of the organization”). The non-applicability of Anti-Terror LawArticle 2/2 to most child demonstrators would thus appear to block the courtsfrom applying Turkish Penal Code Articles 220/6-7 and 314/2-3 tochildren.  To reduce the possibility of any ambiguity on this point, itwould have been preferable for the new law to state directly that 220/6(“committing a crime on behalf of an organization”) and 220/7(“aiding and abetting an illegal organization”), both punishable as“membership in an armed organization,” are no longer applicable tochildren.It should also be noted that under the newlaw, child protestors accused of using explosive substances, including Molotovcocktails, may still be charged with “committing a crime on behalfof a terrorist organization.” Only the implementation will reveal whethercourts continue to press this charge.Overall it will be very important in the months ahead tomonitor the implementation of the July 2010 legal amendments to make sure thatthey have closed the door on the prosecution of child demonstrators as membersof armed organizations simply on the basis of their participation or actionsduring public gatherings.In the days after the amendments had entered into force onJuly 25, courts in Adana, Diyarbakir, and Van, among other places, immediatelyreleased children from prison who were serving sentences or in pretrial detentionon terrorism-related charges. In the coming months the Court of Cassation isexpected to overturn all convictions of child demonstrators meted out by theadult special Heavy Penal Courts.  Special Heavy Penal Courts will issuedecisions of non-jurisdiction for the cases against children and transfer thecases to the juvenile courts.  The children will be retried in juvenilecourts (in children’s heavy penal courts in provinces where such courtsexist) and on the basis of the legal amendments passed as law no. 6008adjustments will be made to the charges on which they stand trial. In mostcases, charges of “committing a crime on behalf of an organization”(Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) used in conjunction with “membershipin an armed organization” (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code) will bedropped. Most children convicted of other offenses (such as “propagandafor a terrorist organization,” Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) are likely tobenefit from sentence postponements.  Since this report was finalizedduring the judicial recess when no retrials had yet begun, from Fall 2010 itwill be important to monitor how the law is applied to new and ongoing cases,as well as to cases in which there is already a confirmed sentence.Of relevance to adult demonstrators as wellas children was a provision in the July amendments which reduced penalties forall those who violate articles of the Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetingsby forcibly resisting police dispersal or offering armed resistance, includingwith stones.[54]  While this report does not deal in detail with articles ofthe Law on Demonstrations and Public Meetings, the amendments to that law mayresult in lower overall sentences for adult demonstrators.The most important failing of the Julylegal amendment was the failure to amend or repeal the extremely punitive laws on“committing a crime on behalf of an organization” (article 220/6)and with it the equally vague “knowingly and willingly aiding andabetting an illegal organization” (article 220/7). These can still beapplied to all adult demonstrators. The greatest failing of the new legalamendment is the fact that the most problematic and vaguely drawn law which,following the case-law, has resulted in long prison sentences for hundreds ofadult and child demonstrators remains in place and will continue to be widelyapplied to anyone aged 18 and over.Statistics on Prosecutions ofChild Demonstrators under Terrorism LawsIn 2009, nongovernmental organizationsattempted to collect their own statistical data on cases of child demonstratorsprosecuted under terrorism laws, which provided a fairly clear picture of thepattern of convictions of children in the courts of Adana and Diyarbakır. It is worth reviewing their researchhere, as nongovernmental organizations will continue to monitor how theimplementation of the July amendments changes the situation of childdemonstrators.In November 2009, the Adana branch of theHuman Rights Association reported that it had identified 106 children convictedof terrorism offenses in the period between June 2008 and October 2009 in theAdana courts (92 of these convictions were in 2009). Of these 106 children, 104had been convicted of “committing a crime on behalf of anorganization” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) and therefore“membership in an armed organization” (Article 314/2, Turkish PenalCode).  Eighty-three had also been convicted of “making propagandafor a terrorist organization” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law).  Afterreductions on account of their ages, these children received prison sentences rangingbetween four and five years. Just two children among the 106 were convictedonly of “making propaganda for a terrorist organization.”[55]Of the group of 106 children, 12 children were13 or 14 years old, and all had stood trial in the Special Heavy Penal Courts,although Turkish law stipulates that children under 15 years of age must betried in a children’s heavy penal court. There is no such court in Adana,and no arrangement was made to transfer the trials to a juvenile heavy penalcourt in another city. All but one of the 12 children under age 15 received aprison sentence of more than four years. These convictions are currently beforethe Court of Cassation and should be quashed following the July 2010 changes inthe law.In January 2010, lawyers on behalf of theAdana branch of the Human Rights Association and the civil society initiativeThose Who Call for Justice for Children (Çocukiçin adalet çağırıcıları),were able to identify 11 ongoing Adana trials in which60 children were being prosecuted under these laws. However, this figure didnot necessarily represent all cases against children in the Adana courts. [56]According to an unpublished October 2009report by the Diyarbakır coordinator of the Justice for ChildrenInitiative (Çocuk İçin Adalet Girişimi),159 children ages 15 to 17 were being tried in ongoing proceedings in theSpecial Heavy Penal Courts in Diyarbakır, and 15 children ages 12 to 14were being tried in the juvenile heavy penal court for terrorism offenses. Atthe time of the report’s completion, in the cases of 93 children, lowercourts had passed verdicts, with convictions in 56 cases.[57] The totalnumber of 267 cases examined concerned trials spanning the period 2008 toSeptember 2009. The report stated that the number of case files examined didnot represent the total number of such cases over that period as there had beendifficulties accessing all files.Human Rights Watch has no recent figures onthe number of prosecutions in the Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara, Van, and Malatyacourts.Lack ofDetailed Statistics on Prosecutions of Demonstrators under Terrorism LawsThe Ministry of Justice has not releasedstatistics on the number of trials opened in 2009 and early 2010 under Articles220 and 314 of the Turkish Penal Code, although all lawyers interviewed in thecourse of the research for this report indicated that they had witnessed asignificant rise in the past two years in the number of prosecutions ofdemonstrators under these articles.Nongovernmental organizations have made no knownattempts to compile data on the number of prosecutions and convictions of adultdemonstrators under the same laws that affected children. However, based oninformation received from lawyers and a survey of case files, the number ofprosecutions and convictions would appear to be much higher.Even if the figures were available, itwould not be possible to tally the number of cases in which Article 220/6 and220/7 are used in conjunction with Article 314 in any year, because the numbersare not disaggregated. Since Article 220 is most commonly used against thoseprosecuted for membership in organized crime, it is not possible to determinehow many cases were initiated against demonstrators. In any case, this report focuseson the increase in prosecutions since the Özer case, which became bindinglaw for lower courts in March 2008.V. Restricting the Rights to Freedom of Assembly and ExpressionDemonstrators face harsh punishments notbecause they are violent—but because the Turkish authorities believe theact of protest on Kurdish issues entails ideological support for the PKK. Prosecutorsand courts have focused on the number of demonstrations an individual has attendedas an important factor in determining whether he or she has been acting onbehalf of an armed organization. We consider here cases in which the defendantcommitted no violent act and in which the content of slogans cannot be arguedto amount to incitement to violence. Instead, in these cases, court recordsestablish that the defendant joined demonstrations on more than one occasionand expressed an outlook ideologically similar to that promoted by an illegalorganization. One judge who has written on the use of terrorism laws in thewake of the General Penal Board’s ruling in the Özer case hassummarized the approach of courts as follows:In cases where it is understood that theperpetrator is engaged in activities and actions which demonstrate thecontinuity, variety, severity and effectiveness of their organic link with theorganization though without posing danger, it is necessary for them tobe punished with the crime of membership in an armed organization [emphasisadded].[58]Case of Veysi KayaVeysi Kaya attended public demonstrationson three occasions between August 2005 and February 2007.Photographicevidence presented at trial established that Kaya was present at ademonstration in Diyarbakır on August 11, 2005, protesting Prime MinisterRecep Tayyip Erdoğan’s visit to the city. He hadalso attended a demonstration against the prison conditions of PKK leaderAbdullah Öcalan on January 16, 2006, and a protest on February 14, 2007,the eve of the anniversary of Öcalan’s capture by the Turkishintelligence services in 1999.[59]Kaya was detained a few days after thethird demonstration and charged with three separate counts of “making propagandafor the PKK” (Article 220/8, Turkish Penal Code), one for eachdemonstration attended. There was no evidence that he had participated in anyviolent action. He was held in pre-trial detention.On the basis of photographic evidenceshowing that at two demonstrations, Kaya had carried banners supporting Öcalan,and on two occasions, he had been seen shouting pro-Öcalan slogans,Diyarbakır Special Heavy Penal Court No. 4 on April 25, 2006 convicted himof three counts of “making propaganda for a terrorist organization or itsaims” (Article 220/8, Turkish Penal Code). The banners the defendant carriedincluded the words, “Öcalan is the only interlocutor—DemocraticPeople’s Initiative” (carried on August 11, 2005), and “Mr.Öcalan is our political representative” (carried on February 14,2006). Based on video footage, Kaya was determined to have shouted thefollowing slogans: “Long live leader Öcalan” (on January 16,2006), and “We are with you, chairman, with our souls and ourblood” on February 14, 2006). For each of these three separate incidents,the Diyarbakır court sentenced him to a one-year prison term, which was ineach case reduced to 10 months, so that his total prison sentence added up to30 months. The court also stripped him of political rights (such as the rightto be elected to public office, to serve on the boards of foundations,associations, trade unions, or political parties) for the duration of hisprison sentence, as is the custom for terrorism offenses (Article 53/1, TurkishPenal Code).[60]The court released Kaya from detention pending the result of his appeal.Following his conviction, thedefendant’s lawyers lodged an appeal against the decision with the Courtof Cassation. On November 4, 2008, following the decision in the Özer case, the Ninth Penal Chamber of theCourt of Cassation quashed the conviction, arguing that on the basis of theevidence Veysi Kaya should not have been convicted of “propaganda”crimes but rather for the more serious offense of “membership in an armedorganization” (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code) because he had“commit[ed] a crime on behalf of an illegal organization, while not …a member of that organization” ( Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) punishablewith a five- to 10-year prison sentence. The Ninth Penal Chamber determinedthat Veysi Kaya should be retried under those articles as well as on propagandacharges, reasoning that he had acted “on the information and under thewishes of the organization by carrying banners praising the organization andshouting slogans when joining a press conference organized on three separatedates in response to the appeal for action following the organization’sstrategy and issued by media channels belonging to the organization.”[61]At the time of writing, the retrial ofVeysi Kaya on these more serious charges was pending in the Diyarbakırcourt. However, given the developing practice of Turkish courts after theÖzer decision, it is almost certain that Kaya will be convicted andreceive a substantially higher prison sentence.Case of Murat IşıkırıkThe case of Dicle University student MuratIşıkırık wasone of the first examples of a confirmed sentence in conformity with thedecision in the Özer case.[62]Murat Işıkırık, a 23-year-old fourth-year student in thePhilosophy Department at Diyarbakır’s Dicle University, was arrestedand placed in pre-trial detention on the basis of video evidence showing himpresent for just eight seconds during an unauthorized demonstration that tookplace on March 5, 2007, on the university campus.The video evidence shows him stoppingbriefly beside some masked demonstrators and clapping, before walking off. Prosecutorsasserted that this protest, which included a boycott of classes, was one of anumber of demonstrations the PKK ordered through sympathetic news outletsagainst the alleged poisoning of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan.After identifying Murat Işıkırık at this protest, the police then discoveredfrom film archives that he had also been part of a mass funeral processionaccompanying the coffins of PKK members on March 28, 2006, which subsequentlyspiralled into violent protests over several days (see above). Video footagerevealed that Işıkırıkhad raised two fingers in a victory sign during the 2006 funeral procession.[63]A subsequent expertise report could not confirm an allegation that he had alsoshouted a slogan. No warrant had been issued for Murat Işıkırık’s arrest after the March 2006 protest,or after another protest on December 21, 2006 that Işıkırık attended, according to video footage. At theDecember demonstration—later excluded from the case by the court—Işıkırık had been among a group, the Dicle UniversityStudents Association (DÜO-Der).At that demonstration, he was filmed clapping and holding one side of a bannercalling for peace and a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between the PKK andthe military.Murat Işıkırık was remanded to pre-trial detention for theduration of his trial. On November 30, 2007, Diyarbakır Heavy Penal CourtNo. 5 convicted him of “committing crimes on behalf of the PKK,”punished as equivalent to membership in the PKK (Articles 220/6 and 314/2-3,Turkish Penal Code) and on two counts of “making propaganda for thePKK” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) and sentenced him to a prison term ofsix years and three months for the former crime and to two sentences of 10months for the latter “propaganda” crime.On January 29,2009, the Court of Cassation upheld the six-year-and-three-month sentence. TheCourt of Cassation ordered a retrial on the count of “making propagandafor the PKK” on procedural grounds. If convicted on that count, Işıkırıkis likely to receive at least an additional 10-month sentence. Işıkırık has been in prison for almost three yearsand has approximately four years left to serve. For his main sentence, he hasno remaining right of appeal left in Turkey, and his lawyers have appliedto the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.In a number of similar cases currentlypending before the Court of Cassation or ongoing in the lower courts, the soleevidence against the defendant is his or her mere presence at a demonstrationand alleged sympathy with the aims of the demonstration. In light of the Courtof Cassation’s recent decisions, the convictions are likely to be upheldon appeal.Case of Mehmet Kocakaya and OthersAnother Dicle University student, MehmetKocakaya, was detained along with other students on April 6, 2009, when heparticipated in a student protest against the fatal police shooting of a fellowstudent.  Mahsum Karaoğlanand another man, Mustafa Dağ,had been killed during an April 4, 2009 march to AbdullahÖcalan’s home village of Ömerli (Kurdish name: Amara) in Urfaprovince to mark the anniversary of the imprisoned PKK leader’s birth andto protest his prison conditions and allegedly insufficient care for his healthproblems. Kocakaya was charged with “membership in the PKK,” on thegrounds of “having committed a crime on behalf of theorganization,” as well as “making propaganda for a terroristorganization,” and he was detained pending trial.[64]The prosecutor stated in the indictment that the student protest was organizedin response to an appeal the PKK issued through the Roja Ciwan website, inwhich the PKK called on the “youth of Kurdistan”  “tocontinue the march to freedom of Mustafa Dağ and Mahsum Karaoğlan,who were executed on their way to Amara to celebrate the leader’sbirthday and ... to stand up more strongly for the will of the people in NorthKurdistan and in all parts of Kurdistan ...” The indictment namedKocakaya as part of a group that organized a boycott of classes that day at thecampus, made the other students leave the building, shouted slogans on thecampus, and “incited the other students to get involved in illegalactivities.” He reportedly also tried to escape apprehension by thepolice. The sole evidence against Kocakaya  is video footage of himshouting  slogans such as  “Long live Chairman Apo,” and “Themartyrs don’t die!” Mehmet Kocakaya was remanded to prison for theduration of his trial. He was released on bail on April 13, 2010, afterreceiving a seven-year-11-month prison sentence, which he has appealed. Threeof four fellow students from the university who stood trial with Kocakaya alsoreceived prison sentences and remain in prison pending the outcome of theirappeals.[65]Case of Three Dicle University Students Campaigningfor the Right to Mother Tongue EducationOn February 25, 2010, Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No.4 convicted three more Dicle University students to sentences ranging from sixyears and three months to seven years and six months in prison for their rolesin a boycott of classes on October 15, 2008, and in a sit-in at which they readout a public statement demanding mother tongue (Kurdish language) education.The prosecutor determined that the PKK had issued appeals for popular protestson the issue of mother tongue education on Roj TV and on websites such asRojaciwan (on September 12, 2008) and Kurdistan-Post (on September 19, 2008).[66]The indictment statesthat a group made up of a “crowd supporting the organization” hadgathered at around 10 a.m. on the university campus and shouted slogans such as“The right to mother tongue language cannot be prevented!”“The PKK is the people and here are the people!” “No lifewithout the leader!” “Don’t sleep, Amed [Diyarbakır],protect your honor!” They had carried yellow, red and green cardboardbanners with slogans in Kurdish relating to mother tongue education: “Ourlanguage is our existence!” “We want our mother tonguelanguage!” “Freedom of language is freedom of the people!”The prosecutor judged “the words they carried, the slogans the groupshouted, the choice of colors on the cardboard banners” as amounting to“propaganda for the illegal PKK terrorist organization on thecampus.”Later, the indictment charges, a group of 20 to 30 people“supporting the organization” entered classes in universitybuildings and banged on professors’ lecterns (kursu), shoutingslogans such as, “Dicle, don’t sleep, protect your honor!”and forcing the students to leave the classrooms.[67]The Diyarbakır court determined that two students—HasanYağizand Özgür Güven—had “hindered the education” ofother students (Article 112/1-b, Turkish Penal Code) “in the frame of theorganization’s [the PKK’s] activities” (Article 5, Anti-TerrorLaw), and also “committed a crime on behalf of the PKK,” punishableas “membership in the PKK.” The court handed them each seven- year-six-month prison sentences (after discretionary reductions). The court ruledthat Nurettin Salhan had “committed a crime on behalf of the PKK”for reading out the public statement.[68]Mehmet Kocakaya (see previous case) andÖzgür Güven were among a group of Dicle University students inprison in Diyarbakır that wrote a letter to the press in March 2010describing their situation:We are over forty Dicle University students held inDiyarbakır D- and E-type prisons. In the face of great difficulties, ourfamilies are putting us through education. Despite not having the means thatour peers in the West have, we worked hard and won places at university. But wedid not become complacent about the political, social and economic problems in ourcountry.For this reason, we struggled to have various democraticevents, seminars, public statements, etc. All the events we joined were lawfuland were democratic and legal actions. Despite this, the security forces put usunder every kind of pressure.[…]Most of our families are outside Diyarbakır.University friends come to visit [us in prison] when they don’t haveexams conflicting with visiting days. Most of our families manage to come tothe open visit once a month. Sometimes they cannot come. Some of us cannotphone our families for the 10-minute per week phone call because the lines to ourvillages are blocked. What remains to us is letters. We also get our examresults from the letters our friends send, not from the notice boards in the university.A prison vehicle (“the hell”) takes us in handcuffs to exams at theuniversity. We are brought to an empty classroom, with a soldier standing infront of each window and door. We do our exams under the supervision ofsoldiers and professors. Anyone who saw us would think we’d planned acoup! Some friends write political solutions on the exam papers, some writearticles and poems, and others send greetings to their friends and professors. Whatshould they do? Some were arrested when they were only in their first year.They either have no books/sources or what they have is inadequate. Even if theyhad, it’s really hard to study or to prepare under prison psychology.Finally, those of us who have signed our names below and those Dicle Universitystudents we couldn’t reach and whose names aren’t written here arefacing punishments of up to 20 to 30 years. While at every trial hearing, wehope to be bailed, like the children who have thrown stones, we face punishmentwith sentences that match our ages. And some of our friends have been sentenced… We are expecting you to raise your democratic voice and we want to seeyou beside us against the injustice we’ve been subjected to and theunlawfulness which the state deems fitting for the  university studentswho are its future …[69]Cases of Vesile Tadik, Medeni Aydın, andSelahattin ErdenIn early 2010, Diyarbakır courts issued a series ofverdicts convicting individuals at their very first trial hearing of“membership in the PKK” and for “committing a crime on behalf of the PKK” becausethey merely shouted a slogan or held up a banner. The cases in question allconcern public gatherings on December 6, 2009, in the towns of Kurtalan, Eruhand Siirt, all in the southeastern province of Siirt, for the reading of apublic statement protesting the prison conditions of Abdullah Öcalan.Scores of people were reportedly prosecuted for their participation indemonstrations in the three towns on the same day, which the police andprosecutor argued came in response to an appeal the PKK issued throughsympathetic media outlets. While Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 6 heardsome of the cases, resulting in acquittals, Diyarbakır Heavy Penal CourtNo. 4 heard some cases, resulting in convictions at the very first hearing.Here we present three such cases.Perhaps the most striking example is the case ofVesile Tadik.The publicprosecutor’s indictment of Vesile Tadik, a 49-year-old mother of six,asserts that on December 6, 2009, she joined a group that gathered outside thedistrict Democratic Society Party (DTP) building in the town of Kurtalan, inSiirt province. The group reportedly walked to the clock tower in the townwhere DTP district head Fikret Örenç read out a public statement protesting the prison conditions andtreatment in prison of Abdullah Öcalan, before the group dispersed“without incident.” Individuals in the crowd reportedly shoutedpro-Öcalan slogans (such as “Long live chairmanÖcalan!”), and Vesile Tadik was caught on a police camera holding upa pro-Öcalan banner. The indictment describes the scene as follows:The suspect Vesile Tadik opened and held up with friends abanner on which was written “The approach to Öcalan is the approachto peace” and actively joined in an illegal demonstration that turnedinto propaganda for a terrorist organization and took place in Kurtalandistrict on December 6, 2009, on the appeal of the PKK terrorist organization.Thus, the investigation determined that the suspect’saim was to make propaganda for a terrorist organization by joining an illegaldemonstration that took place in the district of Kurtalan on the appeal of thePKK terrorist organization, which is an armed organization under Article 314 ofthe Turkish Penal Code no. 5237, because its aim is to separate a section ofthe lands under the sovereignty of the Republic of Turkey from thestate’s governance by means of an armed struggle, and in this region, tocreate an independent Kurdish state with the name Kurdistan, and with this aim,it carries out violent actions (armed attacks, armed clashes, throwing Molotovs,arson, bombings, etc.).[70]The court reasoned that PKK statements to sympathetic media outlets(four broadcasts on Roj TV on four different dates) amounted to a call to thepopulation to demonstrate, and that the gathering had therefore been ordered bythe PKK. It is striking to note that the public prosecutor did not choose tocharge anyone with the reading out of a public statement and organizing thedemonstration, and in fact, Vesile Tadik’s lawyer argues that the publicgathering was a legal one, for which the local DTP had secured permission.On the strength of a photograph of Vesile Tadik holding up abanner that read, “The approach to Öcalan is the approach to peace,”she was convicted at her first court hearing on March 9, 2010, of “makingpropaganda for a terrorist organization” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law)and of “membership in an armed organization” (Article 314/2, TurkishPenal Code) for having “committed a crime on behalf of the PKK” (Article220/6) to a prison sentence of seven years and one month (after discretionary reductions).The slogan itself contained no incitement to violence and falls with theboundaries of free expression.The court also ignored the fact that Vesile Tadik isilliterate, and speaks Kurdish but not Turkish, forcing her to rely on aninterpreter in court. She explained through her interpreter that she had notbeen able to read the banner in Turkish. In view of this, her level ofeducation, and her general circumstances, the prosecutor argued that she shouldbe acquitted. The court disagreed. The case is on appeal.[71]Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4 also convictedMedeni Aydın of “making propaganda for a terrorist organization”(Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) and of “membership in the PKK” (Article314/2, Turkish Penal Code) and of “committing a crime on behalf of thePKK” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code). Medeni Aydın, like VesileTadik, received a seven-year-and-one-month prison sentence (after discretionaryreductions) at his first trial hearing on March 16, 2010. His crime was shoutingthe slogan “Long live Chairman Apo!” and clapping at a December 6,2009 demonstration at which a press statement was read out in front of anassembled crowd in the town of Eruh, in Siirt province.As was the case with Vesile Tadik, Medeni Aydın was notdetained at the demonstration itself, but a few days later, on December 11,when he was brought before the Eruh prosecutor to testify. The prosecutor andcourt decided that the crime of shouting the slogan, “Long live chairmanApo!” was serious enough to justify remanding Aydın to prisonpending trial. He remains in prison pending appeal for shouting a slogan thatthe court should have judged as falling within the boundaries of free speech.On March 16, 2010,Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4 also convicted Selahattin Erden, a 40-year-oldfather with 15 children from two wives, of “making propaganda for aterrorist organization” and of “membership in the PKK” forhaving “committed a crime on behalf of the PKK” to aseven-year-and-one-month prison sentence. He too was placed in pre-trialdetention and remains in prison pending his appeal. Selahattin Erden’scrime at the Eruh demonstration on December 6, 2009 was to have held one edgeof a banner reading, “Either free leadership and free identity, orresistance and revenge to the end!” Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No.6 acquitted Hayrettin Teğin, who held up the other corner of the samebanner, of committing a crime on behalf of the PKK. The court instead sentencedhim to the much lesser offense of “making propaganda for a terrorist organization”(Article 7/2 Anti-Terror Law), for which he received a 10-month sentence butwas released from prison pending appeal.[72]Case of Rihan YıldızRihan Yıldız, a 56-year-oldmother of five, was sentenced at her first hearing on March 11, 2010, to nine yearsand seven months in prison for “membership in a terrorist organization”(Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code) for “committing a crime on behalf ofthe PKK” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) and for four counts of“making propaganda for the PKK” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law).[73]Arrested on December 21, 2009, and remanded to prison the next day, sheremains in a Diyarbakir E-type prison pending the result of her appeal.Rihan Yıldız joined fourdifferent Diyarbakir protests at which public statements were read out. Theevidence against her consisted of video footage showing her shoutingpro-Öcalan and pro-PKK slogans and clapping at the demonstrations, and attwo demonstrations, carrying a banner. The demonstrations she joined took placeon September 30, 2007 (protesting Öcalan’s prison conditions andhealth problems); on March 26, 2008 (protesting fatal shootings by the policeduring Newroz in Van, Hakkari, and Şırnak); on August 19, 2009 (calling fora peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem); and September 11, 2009 (protestingthe arrests of Kurdish Democratic Society Party officials and activists, formembership in the Union of Kurdistan Communities (KCK/TM), a body connectedwith the PKK). At the last demonstration, video footage showed that she hadwalked at the front of the group, holding a banner with the slogan,“Don’t touch my party; don’t touch my political choice; thisoperation will finish you,” referring to the arrests of party officialsand warning the authorities against the clampdown. Prosecutors asserted thatshe shouted slogans including, “Long live chairman Apo!” “Ohleader, we are with you, with our blood and souls!” and “The PKK isthe people, the people are here!” “The ambassador for peace is on İmralı [the island where Öcalan is imprisoned]”[74] During her trial hearing, the court identified her as havingcarried a banner reading “Close down İmralı prison,” at thedemonstration on September 30, 2007, and identifiedother similar slogans, which the video footage showedshe had shouted along with others.The prosecutor argued in the indictmentthat two of the demonstrations were organized in response to PKK“appeals” made through media outlets (Roj TV and the Rojaciwanwebsite), and hence were ordered by the PKK.At her trial hearing, Rihan Yildiz wasnot fluent enough in Turkish to follow the proceedings, and relied on aninterpreter who spoke Kurdish. She stated, “My son died when he was inthe organization [PKK], I joined demonstrations for an end to the crying ofsoldiers’ mothers and the mothers of members of the organization; my aimis peace.” Her lawyer argued that she was illiterate and that she and hermuch older husband had health problems and called for her acquittal and releasefrom prison. In passing the nine-year-and-seven-month prison sentence, thecourt determined that she should remain in prison. The case was on appeal atthe time of this writing.VI. Stone-ThrowingEquated with PKK Membership: Disproportionate Charges and SentencesThe majority of cases examined by HumanRights Watch involved allegations of or evidence that defendants had “violentlyresisted” the police or refused orders to disperse. In most cases this“resistance” took the form of stone-throwing, or much more rarely,throwing Molotov cocktails. Prosecutors often present video evidence to supportthese charges, but numerous convictions have also been made based solely on apolice statement that the defendant was seen resisting orders to disperse.In the casesexamined so far, the prosecutor accused the defendant of “committing acrime on behalf of the PKK,” and therefore of “membership in thePKK” solely on the basis of the defendant’s participation in one ormore demonstrations. In some, but not all, of these cases, the number ofdemonstrations the defendant was alleged to have attended was consideredrelevant to the determination of guilt. Where the defendant is accused ofstone-throwing or other violence, the charge of “committing a crime onbehalf of the PKK,” and therefore, of “membership in thePKK,” need not be proven by evidence of participation in multipledemonstrations. Defendants face the same charges for participation in a singledemonstration.Case of Feyzi Aslan, FatmaGökhan, and Tufan YıldırımFeyzi Aslan, Fatma Gökhan and TufanYıldırım all took part in a Diyarbakır demonstration onMarch 26, 2008. Tufan Yıldırım was accused of making a victorysign and shouting slogans during the demonstration; Fatma Gökhan wasaccused of covering her face with a scarf (poşu) to conceal her identity, and ofhaving been among a group shouting slogans; all three defendants were accusedof having thrown stones at the police.The authorities claim that the PKK usedsympathetic press outlets to broadcast appeals for the demonstration to protestthe harsh policing of earlier unauthorized Nevruz/Newroz demonstrations in thetowns of Siirt, Van, Hakkari, and Yüksekova.[75]The indictment points to PKK statements the Fırat News Agency and the RojaCiwan website broadcast encouraging participation in demonstrations.On March 10, 2009, Diyarbakır Heavy PenalCourt No. 4 convicted the three defendants as follows: TufanYıldırım and Fatma Gökhan received prison sentences of 11years and three months for “membership in the PKK,” (Article 314/2,Turkish Penal Code) for “committing a crime on behalf of the PKK,” (Aricle220/6, Turkish Penal Code) for “making propaganda for the PKK,” (Article7/2, Anti-Terror Law) and for violating the Law on Public Meetings andDemonstrations by violently resisting dispersal (Article 32/3, law no. 2911),and Feyzi Aslan received a prison sentence of 10 years and five months for“membership in the PKK,” for “committing a crime on behalf ofthe PKK,” and for violating the Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations.[76]The case is currently on appeal.Case of H.A.H.A., who was 15 at the time of the incident, and whose fullname is withheld in this report, joined in a demonstration in thetown of Silopi in Şırnak province on October 19, 2008, organized by the local branch of the DemocraticSociety Party (DTP), at which the DTP provincial chair spoke. The demonstrationwas organized under the slogan, “Neither the Justice and DevelopmentParty, nor Ergenekon, the solution is a democratic republic”[77]The prosecutor argued that this slogan didnot reflect the real motivation for the demonstration and that the PKK wasbehind it. He argued that two days before the demonstration, the FıratNews Agency had broadcast news about the alleged ill-treatment of Öcalanin prison, and the PKK military wing had issued a statement to the primeminister threatening to respond to any such “attacks” onÖcalan in the future. The prosecutor also pointed to an October 17, 2008broadcast by Roj TV calling on the Kurdish population to demonstrate and toclose workplaces and boycott school classes to protest Prime Minister Erdoğan’s October 20 visit to the southeast.For these reasons, the prosecutor accusedH.A. of acting under PKK orders when he joined the Silopi demonstration andtherefore charged him with “membership in the PKK,” (Article 314/2,Turkish Penal Code) for “committing a crime on behalf of the PKK,”(Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) along with “making propaganda for thePKK,” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) and violently resisting dispersal.Video evidence showed that H.A. had heldthe corner of a banner that showed Öcalan’s picture and a PKK flag while raising his right hand ina victory sign, had partially hidden his face with a scarf, and had thrownstones at the police. The 15-year-old defendant admitted his actions, butargued that he was not a PKK member, had not joined the demonstration with theintention of making propaganda for the PKK, and had not acted under theorganization’s instructions. Instead, H.A. stated that he “hadjoined in the incidents with the ignorance that comes with group psychology,”and regretted it.H.A. was convicted, and, after benefiting from reductions onthe basis of his age, sentenced to a prison term of seven years and six months.He was released on bail pending the decision on appeal.[78]Following the July 2010 amendments, his sentence should be quashed by the Courtof Cassation. Any retrial will take place in a juvenile court and any prisonsentence should be postponed or otherwise suspended.Case of B.S.B.S., who was 15 years old at time of incident, and whosename has been withheld, participated in a demonstration onOctober 9, 2009, in Batman, on the eleventh anniversary of AbdullahÖcalan’s expulsion from Syria in 1998. She was apprehended by policeat the demonstration and the prosecutor’s indictment described how“defendant B.S., wearing a black-and-white scarf (poşu) with the aim of hiding her face, hadbeen active among a group throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.” Theevidence against her was based on video footage in which she was identified,though there was no video evidence of her actually throwing stones or Molotovcocktails.Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4sentenced B.S. to seven years and six months in prison at her first courthearing on December 29, 2009.[79]The court refused her bail pending appeal.Two lawyers who visited her in the Diyarbakırprison said that she and another young girl prisoner had asked hopefullywhether the lawyers had come to get them out of there and whether they could gohome yet.[80]Following the July 2010 amendments, B.S. was released from prison.[81] Her sentence will be quashed by the Court of Cassation and anyretrial will take place in a juvenile court.There are hundreds of cases of adults and children similarto the five discussed above.Human Rights Watch spoke to several prosecutors about thelaws and the case law that make such convictions possible. One prosecutorexpressed deep concern that the drafting of Article 220 represented a“systemic error,” which could only be rectified by rewriting thelaw:Where once we would apply Article 7/2 of the Anti-TerrorLaw when it came to charging demonstrators who engage in the kind of activitieswe are seeing today, after the General Penal Board’s decision, we are nowobliged to apply Articles 220/6 and 314/2 of the Turkish Penal Code. The caselaw on this serves no good purpose. It isn’t a case of poor implementationby the courts, but rather, case law we must conform with.Referring in particular to children prosecuted under theselaws, he commented: “Those who are caught by the police duringdemonstrations and are put on trial are not experienced, actually. The samechildren who throw stones and Molotov cocktails at the police are often those whowill also agree to play football with them!” He was opposed to the imprisonmentof children, which he felt tended to radicalize them:I’m afraid that after prison these children may go tothe mountains [i.e. join the PKK]. I remember one child who in court wasgenuinely sorry for what he had done and regretted it. Once he had spent timein prison, he wrote to me telling me he had changed his mind, he was angry andno longer regretted anything.[82]These views were not shared by another prosecutorinterviewed by Human Rights Watch. The second prosecutor pointed to “thespecial conditions prevailing in Turkey, which have seen over 35,000 killed dueto terrorism.” He was unwilling to criticize the existing laws or thecase law of the Court of Cassation, but suggested that it was important toattempt to draw distinctions between the kinds of demonstrations that takeplace. Thus, in his view, March 21 Newroz/Nevruz celebrations constitute a morelegitimate grounds for a public gathering, while February 15, the anniversaryof the return of Öcalan to Turkey, is not legitimate. He argued thatprosecutors should think along these lines.[83]VII. Convictions BasedSolely on Police IdentificationIn the cases discussed above, the verdicts depend on videofootage showing the role of the individuals in demonstrations. In other casesexamined by Human Rights Watch, the evidence against the defendants consistedsolely of police reports alleging participation in criminal acts duringdemonstrations without any corroboration. On the basis of such statements,courts have authorized pretrial detention, and these police reports have oftenbeen the main evidence put forward at trial. In many of these cases, the policeidentification of the defendant(s) at the time of the demonstration, and monthslater in court, seems highly questionable, given the difficulties of identifyingindividuals in the middle of large demonstrations. Without corroboratingevidence, these statements raise concerns about possible abuse. Human RightsWatch has concerns that in these cases there is a risk that the police may writeup records claiming to have seen an individual actively participating in ademonstration and throwing stones there, simply because they have apprehendedthat individual and need to justify detaining the person after the fact.Case of Murat BaranIn the case of 21-year-old Murat Baran, apprehended forparticipating in a February 15, 2009 demonstration in Mersin, the police andprosecutor determined that the fact that the individual had half a lemon in hishand was evidence that he had intentionally participated in the demonstration.The police argued that it was common knowledge that demonstrators apply lemonto their faces and eyes to counteract the effects of tear gas. The court agreed,and made no efforts to summon witnesses who might have testified in court as towhether they had seen Murat Baran participate in the demonstration. The individualthus got a nine-year-and-nine-month prison sentence (after discretionary reductions)for “membership in the PKK,” (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code)for “committing a crime on behalf of an organization,” (Article220/6, Turkish Penal Code) for “making propaganda for a terroristorganization,” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) and for resisting thepolice. The only evidence produced was the half lemon in his hand.[84]Murat Baran has been in detention for the duration of his trial and is likelyto remain in prison pending the result of his appeal.The case of Murat Baran is among the most concerning.However, there have also been other examples of individuals detained and placedin pretrial detention in the absence of camera images or witness testimoniesasserting that they participated in a demonstration. In one such case, policeofficers reportedly detained six children between the ages of 13 and 16 in Bingöl on thegrounds that they were sweating and their hands were dusty and sooty,suggesting that they had lit a fire during the protest.[85] Threeof the six were placed in pretrial detention on this basis, to be laterreleased at their first trial hearing.Case of Abdulcelil KaraşAbdulcelil Karaş was seen invideo stills standing apparently silently in the crowd during the March 28,2006 Diyarbakır protests. In court, Karaş claimedthat he had been on his way to the hospital from the café where heworked to collect the results of some medical tests. A police report statesthat Karaş was among those who threw stones at thepolice. One police witness in court identified Karaş. Another stated that he could not positively identify Karaş,but that the content of the police report at the time had been correct. On thisbasis, Karaş,who was released on bail during his trial, received a prison sentence of sixyears and three months. This case is currently on appeal.[86]Case of Salih Özbek,Seyithan Akbal and OthersIn a similar case, five suspects, includingSalih Özbek and Seyithan Akbal, both aged 60, were detained at a protestagainst Prime Minister Erdoğan’s visit to Diyarbakır on October 20, 2008, and wereplaced in pretrial detention. The only evidence against Salih Özbek andSeyithan Akbal is a police report alleging that they were witnessed directing agroup of protestors that violently resisted police dispersal. The police reportclaims the men’s hands smelt of a burning substance, which they concludewas because the men had burnt car tires, and according to the police, therewere traces on the men’s hands that showed they had thrown stones. Videofootage shows the two men present in the demonstration, but not throwing stonesor offering violent resistance. The indictment describes the actions of thedefendants in absolutely identical terms, with each accused of taking aposition at the front of the demonstration. On October 6, 2009, all fivesuspects were convicted. Salih Özbek and Seyithan Akbal were both sentenced to 11 years and threemonths in prison. Salih Özbek is still in prison; Akbal was released onbail at an earlier hearing. Lawyers have appealed the convictions.[87]Case of Ramazan Uçgün and İdris ÜzenRamazan Uçgünand İdris Üzen wereallegedly part of a group that burned car tires and shouted slogans in supportof the PKK and Abdullah Öcalan during a demonstration in Cizre onMarch 20, 2008, the night before the March 21 festival of Newroz/Nevruz. Apolice report represents the sole evidence for the prosecution of the two men.[88]Medical reports show that İdris Üzen suffered a dislocated shoulder, for which he receivedmedical treatment, including a plaster cast, in the hospital.[89]He alleges that his injuries were the result of excessive use of force by thepolice officers who apprehended him, and complained to the prosecutor and incourt. So far, there is no evidence of any investigation into that complaint.After spending almost two years in prisonthrough the duration of their trial, Uçgün and Üzenwere convicted at their twelfth trial hearing of “membership in the PKK”(Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code) on the basis of having “committed acrime on behalf of the PKK,” (Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) inresponse to an “appeal” to protest by the armed group; with“making propaganda for the PKK,” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law) andwith violating the Law on Demonstrations and Public Assemblies. Uçgün received an 11-year-and-three-month prison sentence (afterdiscretionary reductions), and Üzen, a nine-year-and-seven-month prisonsentence (after discretionary reductions).[90]The case is on appeal and the two will remain in prison pending the results oftheir appeal.**  *Media outlets do not even announce some ofthe smaller and more local demonstrations, yet the charge of acting underorders of the PKK is included in all such cases. Courts in Adana in particularhave justified convicting child defendants for the most severe charges by claimingthat the PKK’s “appeal” to participate in demonstrations is acontinuous one, seeming to suggest that no specific address to the localpopulation is needed.Case of M.Ö. and İ.S.M.Ö., who was 15 at time of incident, andwhose name has been withheld, and İ.S., who was age 16 at time of incident, and whose name has been withheld,were apprehended by police at a March 8, 2009 demonstration in a neighborhoodof Adana. According to the prosecutor’s indictment, a group ofapproximately 50 to 60 people had shouted pro-Öcalan slogans, assembledbarricades in the road with trash cans, and resisted police dispersal bythrowing stones. The police apprehended the two defendants, whom they alleged wereamong the group. They were remanded to pre-trial detention and on June 2, 2009,Adana Heavy Penal Court No. 6 convicted them at their first court hearing toprison sentences of four years and nine months under Turkish Penal Code Articles220/6 and 314/2-3 (“committing a crime on behalf of the PKK” and“membership in the PKK”) and for “making propaganda for aterrorist organization” (Article 7/2, Anti-Terror Law).[91] The two defendants were not released on bail. Information abouttheir possible release following the July 2010 legal amendment was notavailable at the time of writing.In this case there is nothing in theindictment to suggest that the PKK made a particular “appeal” todemonstrators to participate in this demonstration. After giving a summary ofthe history of the PKK, naming its various wings and organizational bodies, theindictment identifies a generalized “appeal” to youth toparticipate in protests:All types ofappeals to action in the cities for retaliation against the cross-border anddomestic operations by our security forces against the PKK/ KONGRA-GEL, and foran improvement of the situation of terrorist leader Abdullah Öcalan in İmralI Prison, were made by the senior membersof the organization by means of press and broadcasting channels belonging tothe organzation ...[92]While the Court of Cassation decision in the Özer case and subsequent rulings by localcourts had pointed to direct appeals by the PKK to the population to join aparticular demonstration, the Adana court interpreted this requirement ofshowing an “appeal” by the PKK more loosely, suggesting that theorganization issued a perpetual summons to protest, and so prosecutors need demonstrateno specific appeal to the population to join a particular demonstration. Inpresenting his case in the court on the day of the verdict, the prosecutorstated that, “the defendants complied with the perpetual appeal  toaction of the armed terrorist organization PKK in joining a 100-person group at16:30 on the day of the crime [emphasis added].”[93]***Human RightsWatch has come across two cases in which a judge openly challenged the use ofArticle 220/6 and 220/7 of the Turkish Penal Code, and called on theConstitutional Court to amend the provisions. The same Diyarbakır-basedjudge issued a dissentingopinion in each case, criticizing the decision of the panel to convictindividual demonstrators of “membership in the PKK” on the basis of“having committed a crime on behalf of the organization.”One such case involved Mehmet Fidan, an adultwho was apprehended on February 14, 2008 in the town of İdil in Şırnakprovince after joining an unauthorized demonstration on the anniversary of Öcalan’s capture nine years earlier. The indictment and decision view the event as organized in response toa PKK appeal to demonstrate broadcast on Roj TV on February 3 and 5, 2008, andalso by the Fırat News Agency on February 5, 2008. Mehmet Fidan is said tohave “been among the group, setting up barricades, burning tires, andthrowing stones at the police.”[94]As such, the case resembles scores of others. Mehmet Fidan received a prisonsentence of 10 years and five months for “membership in the PKK” (Article314/2, in conjunction with Article 220/6, Turkish Penal Code) and for violentlyresisting police dispersal of the demonstration. The dissenting judge arguedfor his acquittal, raising many of the points that critics of the law haveraised.Arguing that the first article of the Penal Codeprovides for the protection of rights and freedoms, the public good and thesocial peace, and advocates preventing crime, the judge focused on the need to detersupport for the PKK, and argued that provisions such as Article 314(“membership of an armed organization”) applied by means of Article220 (“committing a crime on behalf of an organization”) would onlyradicalize Kurds and encourage their support for the organization. He arguedthat the current application of the law, whereby individuals could beimprisoned simply for showing their sympathy for the PKK, ironically resultedin “ensuring that they acquired the mindset necessary for membership inthe organization.” He viewed it as counterproductive to try protestors inthe Special Heavy Penal Courts, and suggested that this does more to encourage popularsupport for the PKK than to prevent it. Suggesting that it is highlyproblematic for the state to punish individuals as “members of the PKK,”when they had never joined the PKK’s mountain cadres or undergonemilitary and political training, this judge recommended that lawmakers amend Article220/6 and 220/7 of the Turkish Penal Code.The dissenting judge argued that someprovisions of the Penal Code are intended to strengthen the social peace andprevent crime, including the “Effective Repentance” law. While aperson who spent eight years in the mountains as an armed member  of thePKK would typically get a five-year prison sentence, if that person turned himor herself in, he or she would not have to serve any prison time at all underthe terms of the effective repentance law (Article 221, Turkish Penal Code). Incontrast, if the person had never taken up arms against the Turkish state as amember of the PKK, but had merely been a peaceful demonstrator without anydirect link to the PKK, that person could face a five-year sentence for“membership in the PKK,” without the prospect of reducing oreliminating the prison time that the repentance law provides. Repeatedparticipation in demonstrations and multiple offenses could add years to thesentence.The judge noted that prosecutors have failedto provide evidence that protestors ever heard or read the PKK’s“appeals” to action.There is no concrete evidence that theseappeals have reached these individuals.... but to demonstrate that such appealshave been made on websites, they [PKK statements from news broadcasts] getincluded in the case file by the police, although there is no hard evidencethat the defendant received the summons and committed a crime as a result of it.For this reason, the judge recommended anapplication to the Constitutional Court for the cancellation of Article 220/6.The dissenting judge argued that Mehmet Fidanought to be acquitted.[95]VIII. Human Rights ViolationsTurkeyis party to a number of human rights treaties, including the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights,[96] the European Convention on HumanRights,[97] and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of theChild,[98] which by virtue of Article 90 of the TurkishConstitution, have the force of law in Turkey.[99] These treaties guarantee freedom of expression andassociation, the rights to liberty and security, and due process rights withrespect to detention and the criminal law, all of which Turkey is violating byits harsh practice of routinely detaining and prosecuting demonstrators onterrorism charges. Though these treaties have the force of law in Turkey, noauthority—either the police, prosecutors or the courts—is taking theselegally binding human rights obligations into account when confrontinglegitimate, public action in opposition to the state’s policies ontreatment of the Kurdish minority.Freedom of Expression and AssemblyFreedom of assembly is oftena particular manifestation of freedom of expression, and in the cases examinedin this report, freedom of assembly in southeast Turkey is clearly linked with Kurdishpolitical and cultural expression. Any regulation of, interferences with orrestrictions on the exercise of the right to assembly must also therefore fullyrespect the right to freedom of expression, and other rights, such as the rightto liberty and security. Every time police intervene to disperse an assembly,arrest those at protests and seek to prosecute individuals for the act of participatingin a demonstration, this constitutes an interference with the right to assemblyand expression. Such interferences are only permissible under international lawif they have a proper legal basis, are necessary in a democratic society for alegitimate purpose, and are proportionate.[100]The European Court of Human Rights has made clear onnumerous occasions:… that the rightto freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and isone of the foundations of such a society (see G. v. the Federal Republic of Germany [No. 13079/87, Commission decision of 6 March1989, DR 60]; Rai, Allmond and “NegotiateNow” v. the United Kingdom, no. 25522/94,Commission decision of 6 April 1995, DR 81-A, p. 146). This right, of which theprotection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a numberof exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for anyrestrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whetherrestrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered“necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy acertain but not unlimited margin of appreciation.… the freedom to takepart in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot besubjected to a sanction—even one at the lower end of the scale ofdisciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which hasnot been prohibited, so long as this person does not himself commit anyreprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin…).[101]The cases documented in this report raiseserious concerns about restrictions on freedom of expression, association andassembly, discrimination against those who demonstrate on the Kurdish issue,and disproportionate charges and sanctions. Participants in demonstrations onthe Kurdish question routinely receive dramatically higher sentences thanothers, not because of their conduct during demonstrations, but because oftheir presumed motives for protesting and the political message they are assumedto express. In this regard, the Court has also emphasized that:Freedom of assembly andthe right to express one’s views through it are among the paramountvalues of a democratic society. The essence of democracy is its capacity toresolve problems through open debate. Sweeping measures of a preventive natureto suppress freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases ofincitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles—howevershocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to theauthorities, and however illegitimate the demands made may be—do adisservice to democracy and often even endanger it.In a democratic society based on the rule of law, politicalideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated bypeaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through theexercise of the right of assembly as well as by other lawful means. [102]In the Court’s view,where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important forpublic authorities and officials to show a degree of tolerance towards peacefulgatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of theConvention is not to be deprived of all substance.[103]Clearly in cases such as those documented in this report, the impositionof higher sentences because of political views imputed to the accused is anunjustified restriction on freedom of assembly and expression and a violationof Turkey’s human rights obligations. In practice, in many of these cases, the demonstrators are doing nothingmore than exercising their right to freely express their views. Thegovernment cannot deem such conduct, which in itself is not an offense, to be acrime merely by imputing a motive to participants (assuming that they areacting under orders of the PKK). To infer criminal intent from mereparticipation in a peaceful protest is a clear violation of the right tofreedom of assembly.Principles of Legality, Fair Trial and Due ProcessIndividuals who commitoffenses such as throwing stones and burning tires may legitimately beprosecuted and sanctioned under criminal law. However, the use of an expansiveinterpretation of the law to render acts that are no more than an exercise offreedom of speech, or low-level acts of violence, as terrorism offenses, andsanction them as such, offends international human rights law.Human rights law and the rule of law require that criminallaw be foreseeable and predictable, obligating states to define precisely allcriminal offenses.[104]This obligation finds articulation in several provisions of human rights treatylaw legally binding on Turkey, and is a general principle of criminal law.[105]The European Court of Human Rights explained:The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essentialelement of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention systemof protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it ispermissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. Itshould be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, insuch a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution,conviction and punishment.Accordingly … Article 7 ... embodies, more generally,the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nullapoena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law mustnot be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance byanalogy. From these principles it follows that an offense must be clearlydefined in the law.… The Court thus indicated that when speaking of‘law’ Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to whichthe Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which compriseswritten as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notablythose of accessibility and foreseeability ...[106]The use of anti-terrorism laws against demonstrators inTurkey clearly offends the principles of clarity and legality required byinternational law in general, and by the European Convention on Human Rights inspecific.There is no evidence that the vast majority of thedefendants considered in this report committed any act that would typically orreasonably be considered “terrorism.” The terrorism charges thatare brought against these protestors are wholly disproportionate and do notcorrespond to the nature or gravity of the acts committed. Theevidence leveled against such demonstrators varies widely in substance, raisingfurther fair trial and due process concerns.Human Rights Watchcalls on the Turkish government as a matter of urgency to amend or repeal thelaws that in combination create a legal basis for these abuses ofTurkey’s international legal obligations.UN Special Rapporteur’s Concerns about VaguelyWorded Terrorism LawsIn his first report tothe UN Commission on Human Rights, Martin Scheinin, the UN special rapporteuron the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms whilecountering terrorism, directly addressed the need for laws to adhere to theprinciple of legal certainty and to be clearly and precisely drawn. He remindedstates that for activities to be prescribed by law, “the prohibition mustbe framed in such a way that: the law is adequately accessible so that theindividual has a proper indication of how the law limits his or her conduct;and the law is formulated with sufficient precision so that the individual canregulate his or her conduct.” Furthermore, that “In the prohibitionof terrorist conduct, it is important for States to ensure that prescriptionsto that effect are accessible, formulated with precision, applicable tocounter-terrorism alone, non-discriminatory, and non-retroactive.”[107]Following his 2006 visit to Turkey, Scheininexpressed particular concern about the definition of terrorist crimes inTurkish law. Relating his comments to the definition of terrorism in Article 1of the Anti-Terror Law, he recommended that “the definition ofterrorist crimes should be brought in line with international norms andstandards, notably the principle of legality as required by article 15 of theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), including definingmore precisely what crimes constitute acts of terrorism and confining them toacts of deadly or otherwise grave violence against persons or the taking ofhostages [emphasis added].”[108]Turkish Penal Code Articles 220/6 and 220/7(“committing a crime on behalf of an organization” and“knowingly and willingly aiding and abetting an organization”) arestriking examples of legal provisions that are so vaguely worded and lacking inclarity about what is prohibited as to offer an individual no indication of howto regulate or limit conduct. The special rapporteur also stated in relation toTurkey: “Only full definitional clarity with regard to what actsconstitute terrorist crimes can ensure that the crimes of membership, aidingand abetting and what certain authorities referred to as ’crimes ofopinion’ are not abused for other purposes than fightingterrorism.”[109]As the cases examined below demonstrate, the application of Turkish Penal CodeArticle 220/6 and 314/3, in conjunction with Article 314/2 (“membershipin an armed organization”), directly bear out the concerns raised by thespecial rapporteur.While the case of Felat Özer included evidencethat Özer was among a group engaged in violent resistance to the police,it is important to note that the reasoning of the General Penal Board of theCourt of Cassation did not focus on the matter of whether Özer had engagedin violent resistance to the police or had endangered lives through violentactions. Rather, the board focused on the matter of whether demonstrations hadbeen organized or ordered by the PKK, as evidenced by the organization’sstatements. As such, the General Penal Board was not primarily interested inindividual actions within demonstrations, and the pattern of convictions todate suggests that evidence of violent activities only contributes to theapplication of additional charges (such as damaging public property, or violentlyresisting dispersal) on top of the standard charge of “committing a crimeon behalf of an organization,” indicating the charge of “membershipin an armed organization.”Subsequent cases have followed this line ofreasoning. Thus, the courts have focused on participation in a demonstrationallegedly called by the PKK, rather than on violent conduct. In fact, as thecases documented in this report show, a number of convictions involve onlynonviolent expressions of opinion that arguably do not amount to incitement toviolence but rather are within the boundaries of protected expression.IX. SpecificConcerns Related to Prosecution of Child DemonstratorsFollowing the positive changes to the lawintroduced by the Turkish government in July 2010, Human Rights Watch continuesto have two areas of concern about the treatment of child demonstrators onapprehension. The first concern is that the new law does not end thepossibility that some children detained following demonstrations will be placedin pre-trial prison detention for extended periods. The second area of concernis the failure of the authorities to investigate the reports that childdemonstrators have been ill-treated following apprehension by members of thesecurity forces.Pre-trial Detention of ChildrenIn the majority of cases of childdemonstrators Human Rights Watch reviewed, the defendants were remanded intocustody pending trial. Given the lengthy processes of Turkish courts, this pre-trialperiod could be as long as one year. Local human rights and children’srights groups interviewed for this report frequently raised concerns that thedetention of child demonstrators removes them from family socialization and maydeprive them of the possibility of continuing their education. Some expressedconcern that many children might become radicalized in prison and in thelong-term profoundly alienated from their families and the broader society.Under the United Nations Convention on theRights of the Child, children should be arrested, detained, or imprisoned“only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriateperiod of time.”[110]The best interest of the child must be a primary consideration.[111]In its 2001 review of Turkey, the United Nations Committee onthe Rights of the Child expressed concern about children’s“long periods of pre-trial detention and the poorconditions of imprisonment and the fact that insufficient education,rehabilitation and reintegration programs are provided during the detentionperiod.”[112]It reminded Turkey that “pre-trial detention should be used only as ameasure of last resort, should be as short as possible and should be no longerthan the period prescribed by law. Alternative measures to pre-trial detentionshould be used whenever possible.”The Committee reiterated these concerns in September 2009,urging Turkey to:[…]c.) Ensure that children are only detained as ameasure of last resort and for the shortest possible time period. If in doubtregarding the age, young persons should be presumed to be children;d.) Guarantee that children, if accused of having committedterrorist crimes, are detained in adequate conditions in accordance with theirage and vulnerability;e.) Inform parents or close relatives where the child isdetained and allow contact;g.) Guarantee children a periodic and impartial review oftheir detention;h.) Ensure that children in detention have access to anindependent complaints mechanism. Reports of cruel, inhuman and degradingtreatment of detained children should be investigated in an impartial manner;i.) Afford educational programmes and recreationalactivities, as well as, measures for all detained children’s socialreintegration;[113]In numerous cases against Turkey, theEuropean Court of Human Rights has held that pre-trial detention of children istoo lengthy, finding violations of the right to release pending trial. Forexample, in the case of Selcuk v. Turkey, the court concluded“having regard particularly to the fact that the applicant was a minor atthe time, the Court finds that the authorities have failed to convincinglydemonstrate the need for the applicant’s detention on remand for morethan four months.”[114] In the case of Nart v. Turkey, “especially havingregard to the fact that the applicant was a minor at the time” the Court ruled that 48 days was too long a period of pre-trialdetention. [115]A review of ongoing legal proceedings against childdemonstrators reveals that prolonged pretrial detention was being widely usedin 2009. A sample of ongoing cases in Diyarbakır and Adana courts revealedthat children (several of them on trial in the Diyarbakır courts as youngas 13 and 14) were typically placed in pretrial detention for periods of fivemonths, but in a significant number of cases, they were detained for periods ofover a year. For example, Human Rights Watch examined the casesagainst 40 children on trial for participating in a February 16, 2008demonstration in Cizre, and they were held in pre-trial detention for a periodof over one year.[116]The prison population in Turkey is known tohave increased significantly over the past few years, with a high percentage ofremand prisoners, making overcrowding very common.[117]A report on an April 2009 visit to the children’s dormitory of DiyarbakırPrison by the Turkish Medical Association raised serious concerns about prisonconditions.[118]Because we focus here primarily on laws, inthe course of the research for this report there was no attempt to undertake awider study of the treatment of children or adults in places of detention. However,a representative of Human Rights Watch and representatives of the coalition ofdomestic NGOs calling themselves the Justice for Children Initiativeinterviewed a sample of 10 child demonstrators in Adana following their releasefrom prison. Given the seriousness of the reported irregularities in thehandling of child suspects, including allegations that they were ill-treated, asummary of the findings from the sample interviewed in Adana is included here.Ill-Treatment and ProceduralIrregularities in the Handling of Child Suspects[119]In May-June 2009 interviews with 10children who had been released from pre-trial detention in Adana and werefacing continuing legal proceedings in the Adana courts, Human Rights Watchheard allegations of ill-treatment in every case.[120]Both boys and girls reported ill-treatment—typically being roughed up,slapped or beaten—as they were apprehended by members of the RapidDeployment Force (Çevik Kuvvet). The boys also reportedbeing beaten, slapped, threatened, and sworn at by gendarmes and prison guards upontheir arrival at the Kürkçüler E-type adult maleprison, where boys were routinely held, separately from adult men for periodsof about a week before being transferred to PozantıChildren’s Prison. The boys also gave consistent reports of doctors slappingand verbally abusing them in Kürkçüler E-typeprison. As a result, many had felt completely unable to report ill-treatment bygendarmes and prison guards on arrival at the prison. For the most part, theboys had not seen lawyers while in the E-type prison, and therefore anycomplaints of ill-treatment were generally lodged much later, often at a firstcourt hearing. (The girls were transferred to a women’s prison and HumanRights Watch heard no reports of ill-treatment at the prison from them.) Thefindings of Human Rights Watch support the wider investigation into theill-treatment of child demonstrators undertaken in 2009 by the Adana branch ofthe Human Rights Association. The association documented many reports ofill-treatment of child demonstrators at different stages of their detention. Allthe children Human Rights Watch interviewed complained of sleep disorders,weight loss, and difficulty in resuming their old lives following their releasefrom prison.All of the children Human Rights Watch interviewedin Adana reported irregularities in the handling of their cases. The keyproblems identified included:i)Child suspects wereroutinely held at the Anti-Terror Branch of the Security Directorate forperiods of several hours before transferring them to the Children’sBranch of the Security Directorate. During this time, children were frequentlyinterviewed by police officers without the presence of a prosecutor or lawyer.Both these practices contravene Turkey’s domestic law.ii)      Children were not informed of their rights asdetainees, or of their right to have a family member informed of theirdetention; their families were not promptly informed of their detention and insome cases, were erroneously told the children were not in detention.iii)    In the case of children the medical examination(compulsoryfor anyone held in police custody) at the Forensic Institute in Adana wasroutinely undertaken superficially and with the door open and within earshot ofthe police.iv)    Children in Adana had no access to lawyersuntil they were brought before a prosecutor for interrogation. Meetings withlawyers were hastily conducted outside the prosecutor’s room in thecourthouse, if at all, and therefore in a manner that barely meets their right underTurkish law to benefit from legal counsel.After this report was researched, otherreports emerged of ill-treatment of child detainees in Adana. Adana lawyerslodged complaints of serious ill-treatment of children in Ceyhan M-type prison.The children, H.Y., U.D., A.A., K.F., İ.T., H.Ş.,and M.D.,[121]were transferred on January 22, 2010, from Pozantı Boys Prison to CeyhanM-type prison. They reported to their lawyer that prison guards subjected themto prolonged beating with batons when they requested that they all betransferred together to a particular ward that held adult male politicalprisoners. In fact, they could not have legally been transferred to the adultward because of their age, but their request reportedly triggered a dispute,and ill-treatment by the prison guards. They also reported to their lawyer thatguards poured buckets of cold water over them. Their lawyer reported to HumanRights Watch that at the time of his meeting with the children, they borevisible signs of having been beaten. One child had sustained a head injury, which was bandaged.[122]Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment of anydetainee is strictly prohibited under international law. The Convention on theRights of the Child explicitly reiterates this universal prohibition in respectof children. International guidelines on the detention of juveniles alsorequire that a parent or guardian be notified immediately when a child isapprehended.[123]In 2009, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of theChild called on Turkey to:Ensure that children in detention have access to anindependent complaints mechanism. Reports of cruel, inhuman and degradingtreatment of detained children should be investigated in an impartial manner.X. RecommendationsTo the Turkish Government:Amend laws applicable to adults and childrenUrgently amend Turkish Penal Code Article220 (“forming criminal organizations”), and repeal 220/6 (“committinga crime on behalf of an organization”) and 220/7 (“aiding andabetting an organization knowingly and willingly”), which are vague, lacklegal clarity and specificity, and are therefore subject to arbitraryapplication.Urgently repeal Turkish Penal Code Article314/3 and Anti-Terror Law Article 2/2 (“committing acrime on behalf of an organization”) providing for the linkage ofarticle 314/2 (“membership in an armed organization”) and Article220/6 and 220/7 (above), as discussed in this report.Amend Anti-Terror Law Article 7/2(“making propaganda for a terrorist organization”) and TurkishPenal Code Article 220/8  (“making propaganda for an organization orits objectives”) to prevent them from being used to restrict freedom ofexpression and peaceful assembly and to bring them into conformity with thecase law of the European Court of Human Rights.Set up a review board to examine all casesconcluded under these articles for compliance with international human rightslaw obligations, with a view to quashing sentences under Turkish Penal Code Articles314/2 and 314/3 in connection with Articles 220/6 and 220/7.Instruct the prosecuting authorities toimpose a moratorium on all ongoing prosecutions under the offending provisions,so that they can be reviewed and assessed for compliance with internationalhuman rights law. All prosecutions which would violate international humanrights standards should be dropped immediately.Following the July 2010 repeal of Articles 9and 13 of the Anti-Terror Law, review all convictions of juveniles currently onappeal or upheld by the Court of Cassation and ensure that they are swiftlyquashed and transferred to juvenile courts for retrial, or that charges are droppedunder the terms of the new law.To the Judiciary:Limit pre-trial detention of adult demonstratorsEnsure that decisions regarding remand andpre-trial detention are in strict compliance with international human rightsstandards, which are legally binding and have the force of law in Turkey. Undersuch standards, pre-trial detention should be the exception, not the norm and courtsshould supply a fully reasoned explanation of decisions to prolong pre-trialdetention of individuals standing trial for participation in demonstrations.In line with international human rights law,refrain from placing in pre-trial detention nonviolent demonstrators against whomthere is no evidence that they will not present for trial, or would interferewith witnesses or evidence.End the pre-trial detention of child demonstratorsEnd the practice of prolonged detention ofchildren in fulfillment of Turkey’s obligations under the UN Conventionon the Rights of the Child and in conformity with the case law of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights. Ensure that children are detained only as a matter oflast resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.Investigate all allegations of ill-treatment of childdetaineesEnsure any allegations of ill-treatmentlodged by child suspects /defendants raised before judges are investigated. To the Police and Prosecuting Authorities:Bring the handling of apprehended childdemonstrators into conformity with the lawEnd violations of the Criminal ProcedureCode in the handling of child suspects. Child suspects must be transferredimmediately to the Children’s Department of the Security Directorate; amember of their family must be immediately informed of their detention, andchild detainees must be promptly informed of their rights.Bar associations should be immediatelyadvised of all child detainees, so they can ensure the immediate provision oflegal aid to all child suspects in police detention in accordance with theCriminal Procedure Code.Prosecutorsshould take steps to investigate any allegations of ill-treatment lodged bychild suspects /defendants and give child suspects/defendants the opportunityto lodge such complaints at any stage following their apprehension by lawenforcement officials.Conduct an independent investigationinto allegations that gendarmes, prison guards, and doctors working at AdanaKürkçüler E-type prison in the first six months of 2009 beat andotherwise ill-treated adults and children. Conduct thorough investigations intoall other reports of ill-treatment by members of the security forces and prisonguards to combat the culture of impunityTo Turkey’s International Partners, includingthe European Union and the United States:Use every opportunity toencourage the Turkish authorities to undertake the aforementioned reforms toaddress the concerns detailed in this reportAppendix: Translations of Relevant Articles:2005 Turkish Penal Code and 2006 Revision to the Anti-Terror Law1) Laws used to penalize demonstrators:Turkish Penal Code Articles 220/6 incombination with 314/2 and 314/3Forming organized groups with theintention of committing a crimeARTICLE 220-(1)Those who establish or direct an organization for the purpose ofcommitting crimes shall be sentenced to imprisonment of two to six years if thestructure of the organization, number of members, equipment and supplies aresufficient to commit the intended crimes.

Anascent Kurdish nationalism colored some of these uprisings; some also carriedreligious overtones against the new secular order; in others, residents ofperipheral areas resisted incorporation into a centralizing and homogenizingnew state. The state authorities denied the very existence of Kurds, includingtheir cultural or linguistic identities. During the conflict with the PKK,officials began to acknowledge the Kurds as an ethnic group.

The case concerns a group who joined two authorized Ankarademonstrations on December 17, 2005 and February 19, 2006 that were attended bya broad coalition of trade unionists and activists. The defendants in thistrial were accused of knowingly and willingly aiding and abetting an illegalorganization (the armed Marxist Leninist Communist Party: MLKP),  Thesecharges were based primarily on evidence  that they had shouted slogans atthe demonstration, had carried banners with slogans, and had publicationssympathetic to the outlawed organization in their possession. Documentationprovided to Human Rights Watch by lawyer Rahşan Aytaç Sala.[27]“Terör örgütüne mensup olmasa dahi örgüt adına suç işleyenler de terör suçlusu sayılır ve örgüt mensupları gibi cezalandırılırlar,” Article 2/2, Anti-Terror Law (no. 3713).[28]Turkish Penal Code Articles61 and 62 on sentencing outline the criteria for judges to apply discretionaryreductions in sentencing, which are in most cases reductions of one fifth.[29] For example, an adult demonstrator who isprosecuted for “committing a crime on behalf of the PKK,” may besentenced to 7.5 years in prison (which becomes six years and three monthsafter discretionary reductions), plus an additional year for “makingpropaganda for the PKK,” (which becomes 10 months after discretionaryreductions). The total sentence to be served would be 8.5 years (which becomesseven years and one month with reductions). The demonstrator may be sentencedon more than one count of “making propaganda” if he or she hasattended more than one demonstration, increasing the sentence by one year (10months after reductions) for each count. On top of this, many demonstrators aresentenced to further prison time for violating the Law on Demonstrations andPublic Meetings (Law no. 2911). A demonstrator may receive a five-year sentence(which becomes four years and two months after discretionary reductions) for“armed resistance to police dispersal” (Article 33/c, Law no.2911). The three charges together would bring the sentence up to 13 years (11years and three months, with reductions). Had the demonstrator resisted policedispersal on more than one occasion, he would receive separate sentences on eachcount, increasing the sentence.[30]The possible 28-year total prisonsentence consists of the following components: a 10-year sentence for“membership in an armed organization” on the basis of having“committed a crime on behalf of the organization” under Articles314/2, 314/3, and 220/6 of the Turkish Penal Code (increased by one-half to 15years, on the basis of Article 5 of the Anti-Terror Law providing foraggravated sentences); a five-year sentence for “making propaganda for aterrorist organization” under Article 7/2 of the Anti-Terror Law; and aneight-year sentence for having forcibly resisted dispersal of a demonstrationby the police under Article 33/c of the Law on Demonstrations and PublicAssemblies. This leaves out other possible charges, such as “damagingproperty,” (Articles 151/1 and 152/1a, Turkish Penal Code), which wouldincrease the sentence by up to three years, “damaging publicproperty” (Article 152/1a, Turkish Penal Code), which could increase itup to six years, and “resisting a public official” (article 265/1,Turkish Penal Code), which would increase the sentence by up to three years.[31]Because this report chooses to highlight the applicationof the offense of “committing a crime on behalf of anorganization,” with its much more severe penalty, we have chosen not tofocus here on prosecutions under article 7/2 of the Anti-Terror Law.[32]However, under the 2006 amendments,those under 15 years of age were able to receive a suspended or delayedsentence, which was not applicable to children ages 15-17 and adults convictedunder the Anti-Terror Law (article 13).[33]General Penal Boarddecision (no. 2007/9-282;Decision no. 2008/44, March 4, 2008): copy in possession of Human Rights Watch.[34]http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=4160330&tarih=2006-02-28(accessed September 12, 2009).[35]See the report on the incidents by theDiyarbakir branch of the human rights group Mazlum Der;http://www.mazlumder.org/haber_detay.asp?haberID=94; by the Diyarbakir BarAssociation; http://ortakpayda.org/makale.asp?foo=read&feox=326; by theHuman Rights Association;http://www.ihd.org.tr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=106:28-mart-2006-darbakir-olaylarina-k-celeme-raporu&catid=34:el-raporlar&Itemid=90.See also the report by Democratic Society Party (DTP) members of parliament,dated April 14, 2006,http://ortakpayda.org/boxes.asp?foo=read&feox=62&ronin=4.  For anassessment of the incidents blaming the PKK by a department of the Ministry ofInterior, and including a selection of critical commentary from newspapercolumnists, see http://www.arem.gov.tr/rapor/basin/teror_son_donem_olaylar.htm(all accessed September 8, 2009).[36]See the reports by Mazlum Der and theHuman Rights Association discussed in the previous footnote.

They were chargedunder the Anti-Terror Law with “making propaganda for a terroristorganization,” (Article 7/2) and were sentenced to six months and 20 daysin prison. They were at liberty during their trial proceedings, and their caseis still on appeal. Aslan and Akın were accused of conduct identical tothat of many of the demonstrators whose cases are examined in this report, yettheir sentence was substantially less than would be the case today.Inanother example, demonstrator Hasan Bayram was accused of shoutingpro-Öcalan and pro-PKK slogans and being part of a group throwing stonesat the police during a January 11, 2006 public assembly in Diyarbakır. Theoccasion for the public assembly was the reading of a statement protesting adisciplinary punishment reportedly meted out to Abdullah Öcalan in prison.After the statement was read, the assembled crowd reportedly resisted dispersaland threw stones at the police. Bayram was caught on the police cameras. Hereceived a 10-month prison sentence for “making propaganda for aterrorist organization” (Article 7/2 Anti-Terror Law) (Decision of theDiyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4; Decision no. 2006/193, September 29,2006, in the possession of Human Rights Watch).[46]A coalition of NGOs called the Justicefor Children Initiative (Çocukiçin Adalet Girişimi) shouldalso be mentioned for its efforts to raise the issues publicly, via the mediaand advocacy efforts.[47]See Concluding Observations on Turkeyof the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 52nd session, September14, 2009,http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-OPAC-TUR-CO1.pdf (accessedMarch 21, 2010).[48]Ibid.[49]'Taş atan çocuklara' yeniformül” (New formula for the stone-throwing children”), Radikaldaily newspaper, September 30, 2009, http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetay&ArticleID=956902&CategoryID=77(accessed October 27, 2009).[50]See draft law,http://www2.tbmm.gov.tr/d23/1/1-0775.pdf (accessed April 30, 2010).
