Summary and RecommendationsOn January 16, 2011, former president-for-life of Haiti, Jean-Claude"Baby Doc" Duvalier, returned to his homeland after nearly 25 yearsin exile. The government of Haiti responded by re-opening a 2008 investigationinto alleged financial crimes, and several victims of serious human rightsviolations under the Duvalier government also came forward and filed complaintswith the prosecutor. The investigation into Duvalier’s alleged financialand human rights crimes is currently underway.This report provides an overview of human rights violationsunder Duvalier, details the current status of the proceedings against him,including obstacles to a successful prosecution, and analyzes applicableHaitian and international law. We conclude that investigation and prosecutionof the grave violations of human rights under Duvalier’s rule is requiredby Haiti’s obligations under international law. While there are stillobstacles to overcome, the case presents an historic opportunity for Haiti.Successful prosecution of Duvalier is important not only forDuvalier’s many victims, but also for Haiti’s struggling judicialsystem and for Haitian society more broadly. Bringing Duvalier to justice andgiving him a fair trial could help restore Haitians’ faith in the justicesystem and the rule of law. A prosecution could also act as a deterrent toother leaders, both in Haiti and elsewhere, demonstrating that they can be heldaccountable for serious violations of human rights.The challenges to fair and transparent prosecution ofDuvalier, however, are enormous. Haiti’s judicial system is weak, thecase requires continuing investigations and evidence-gathering, and significantprocedural hurdles need to be addressed, in particular the mistaken view insome quarters that the prosecution should be barred by Haiti’s statute oflimitations. As this report shows, those obstacles are not insurmountable. Thesuccess of the case will depend on the political will of the government ofHaiti to uphold its obligations under international law and rigorously pursuewhat could be the most important criminal case in its history, and on thewillingness of the international community to provide essential support now andas the case develops.Human Rights Abuses under Jean-Claude DuvalierUnder the leadership of Jean-Claude Duvalier, the governmentof Haiti relied on an extensive network of security forces to enforce itscontrol through a pattern of human rights abuses, including:Political Prisoners and the “Triangle of Death”:Hundreds of political prisoners held in a network of three prisons known as the“triangle of death” died from maltreatment or were victims ofextrajudicial killings.“Disappearances” and Political Killings: Manypolitical prisoners who entered the triangle of death were never released, andtheir whereabouts remain unknown to their families. Summary executions ofprisoners are also alleged to have occurred, including prisoners at FortDimanche on August 7, 1974, seven people executed on March 25, 1976, and eightprisoners reportedly executed at Morne Christophe and Titanyen on September 21,1977. Political killings by security forces also took place.Torture: Political prisoners often faced interrogation andsavage torture. A common method of torture—the djak in HaitianCreole—involved tying the hands of prisoners behind their legs, andpushing a stick or bar between their legs and arms. The prisoners tied in thisposition would be drawn into a ball around the stick, and beaten withsticks.Repression of the Press and Political Dissent: Freedoms ofassociation, assembly, and expression were severely restricted. The governmentrepeatedly closed independent newspapers and radio stations. Journalists werebeaten, jailed and forced to leave the country.The Proceedings against DuvalierShortly after Duvalier fled the country in 1986, the newgovernment established a commission to investigate the financial corruption ofthe Duvalier government and soon instituted criminal proceedings againstDuvalier for financial crimes. In 2008, another investigation was opened and includedcrimes against persons. The government re-instituted these pending cases whenDuvalier returned in January 2011. As of March 16, 2011, 19 Haitian victims ofDuvalier also had filed complaints with the state prosecutor related to crimesagainst humanity and human rights violations.Theories of Duvalier’s LiabilityHuman Rights Watch hasnot seen any evidence that Duvalier was present when the murders, acts oftorture, “disappearances,” or arbitrary detentions of suspects tookplace; however, physical presence at a crime scene is not necessary toestablish criminal liability. Under international and Haitian law, Duvalier canbe held criminally responsible via the doctrines of:Accomplice Liability to Crimes Committed by Subordinates: Evidence exists that Duvalier directly ordered certain crimes, including theNovember 1980 mass arrest of activists, many of whom were tortured andexpelled.Command Responsibility: Duvalier, the legal superior ofthe security forces who committed the crimes discussed in this report, may becriminally liable for those crimes as he was repeatedly made aware of thecrimes and failed to take measures to prevent the crimes or to punish theirperpetrators.Haiti’s Obligation to Investigate and PunishDuvalier’s Alleged CrimesDuvalier’s alleged crimes, including murder, torture,and false imprisonment, are serious crimes under Haitian law. Underinternational law, which is binding on Haiti and has been incorporated intoHaitian law, Haiti has a duty to investigate and punish perpetrators of serioushuman rights abuses, a duty which cannot be undermined by statutes oflimitations, amnesties, or other domestic legal obstacles. In addition, thecontinuous nature of several of the alleged crimes, namely enforceddisappearances and false imprisonment, prevent their prescription, because thestatute of limitations has not begun to run.Institutional Challenges Facing the ProsecutionThe investigation and trial of a former head of state formass crimes committed between 25 and 40 years ago will be a complex endeavor.Further complicating the issue are the challenges currently facing the Haitianjudicial system, including problems of capacity, limited resources, andpolitical will. But all of these obstacles can be overcome:Weak Capacity can be Bolstered by International Support:The Haitian legal system will have difficulty pursuing the case without broadersupport to bolster its weak infrastructure, but with concerted internationalefforts, a fair trial for Duvalier in Haiti could kick-start rule of lawefforts and help to begin building the state institutions that Haitiansdeserve.Limited Resources Can Be Used Efficiently: Limitedresources can be maximized by development of a targeted and efficientprosecution strategy.Lack of Technical Expertise can be Addressed with ExpertSupport: Haiti does not have the experience, and thus, at present, theexpertise to pursue this type of investigation and prosecution. It needstechnical support from the international community.A Safe Political Environment can be Created through PoliticalSupport: The government has not done enough to ensure a safe environmentfor witnesses, prosecutors, court staff, and defense attorneys. Protectionsmust be in place for the prosecution to be effective and fair. With a newadministration potentially less committed to the Duvalier prosecution soon totake power in Haiti, the international community also has a role to play insupporting and encouraging witnesses and officials currently in charge of thecase, and in ensuring that the prosecution is carried through to completionregardless of who is in power in Haiti.RecommendationsTo the Government of HaitiMaximize available resources for the prosecution by:Working with international donors and the UN High Commissionerfor Human Rights to ensure that judicial reform efforts are effectivelytargeted to pursue the investigation and prosecution of Duvalier.Developing a targeted prosecution strategy, selecting arepresentative sampling of the gravest crimes for which there is the strongestevidence.Assigning sufficient human resources to the investigation andprosecution.Facilitatingmechanisms for members of the diaspora to file complaints and testimonywith the court.Foster a safe political environment for the prosecution by:Providing security to victims, witnesses, judicial officers, andothers who may be at risk, in collaboration with the Haitian National Policeand the MINUSTAH police forces.Publicly acknowledging Haiti’s obligation under internationallaw to prosecute Duvalier’s alleged crimes.Ensuring that judicial authorities can operate independently andwith sufficient resources.Ensuring that Duvalier’s rights to a fair trial are fullyrespected.To Haitian Judicial AuthoritiesEnsure that Jean-Claude Duvalier receives a fair trial inaccordance with international standards.To the International Community and Donor StatesPublicly support Haiti’s attempt to fulfill itsinternational obligations by investigating and prosecuting Jean-Claude Duvalier.Provide technical and financial support to the Haitian justicesystem to pursue the investigation and prosecution of Duvalier, includingthrough:Sending temporary legal staff with experience in complexinvestigations and prosecutions to work alongside Haitian judicial officers.Incorporatingsupport for this complex prosecution into existing rule of law programs.Assist the government of Haiti in gathering evidence for the casethrough the release of diplomatic cables and other evidence relevant toDuvalier’s prosecution, including information that demonstrates theinternational community had put Duvalier on notice of crimes being committed inHaiti.Note on MethodologyThis report is based on extensive archival research andinterviews conducted during two Human Rights Watch visits to Haiti in Februaryand March 2011. Some of the archival research was also conducted in the UnitedStates Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.Human Rights Watch met with governmental officials todiscuss the status of the prosecution, and interviewed local nongovernmentalorganizations, lawyers, journalists, and diplomats. Human Rights Watch also metwith and conducted interviews with several victims who have filed complaintsagainst Duvalier in domestic court.This report draws heavily from legacy reports of HumanRights Watch (then named Americas Watch) and Amnesty International as well asthe 1979 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report.II.Human Rights Abuses under Jean-Claude DuvalierWhen Jean-Claude came to power, I was not released. . .instead, the conditions of my and my brother’s detention got worse. Mybrother died in the National Penitentiary in 1972 of bad treatment. I stayed inprison for eight years, six of them under Jean-Claude.[1]—Jean, political prisoner arrested without charge September 23,1969 and released February 18, 1977, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 17, 2011Jean-Claude Duvalier’s government perpetratedwidespread crimes and human rights violations during his 15-year presidency.There is substantial evidence that military, paramilitary, and police officerscommitted these violations while under Duvalier’s de facto and dejure control. In some cases, there is evidence that they acted under thedirect order of Duvalier. Throughout Duvalier’s 15-year rule, humanrights organizations, foreign politicians, donor governments, diplomats, andthe Inter-American Commission for Human Rights raised their concerns aboutthese crimes. Thus, Duvalier was on notice and had knowledge that serious humanrights violations were occurring under his command.Jean-Claude Duvalier came to power in 1971 at age 19,succeeding his father as president-for-life. His father, François“Papa Doc” Duvalier (hereinafter Duvalier père),“executed hundreds of people, imprisoned hundreds more, and drovethousands into exile, while running the country with an iron fist”according to US embassy officials.[2]Inheriting this brutal regime from his father, Duvalier’s 15-year rulefrom 1971 to 1986 was marked by grave human rights violations against hischallengers and critics—opposition party members, trade unionists,independent journalists, university professors, and human rightsactivists—and by an absence of fundamental freedoms.The international community initially hoped that Jean-ClaudeDuvalier’s government would be less brutal than his father’s. TheUnited States Ambassador to Haiti at the time of Duvalier’s ascension,Clinton Knox, suggested hopefully that “new departures of this regimerepresent a general trend towards liberalization.”[3] Incleaning up its image, the new government sought to reinvigorate the flow ofinternational assistance that had tapered, and at times disappeared, underFrancois Duvalier’s government. Secretary of State for Defense and theInterior, Luckner Cambronne, sought to convince the United States ofDuvalier’s good intentions. In a meeting with Knox, Cambronne indicatedthat “the [government of Haiti’s] record over Jean-Claude’sfirst year in office is a good one and entitles the country to assistance fromabroad.”[4]The ambassador warned, however, that there remained a risk that“[e]xpectations [of the populace] may rise to the point where thegovernment will feel threatened and compelled to adopt repressive measures tokeep the situation in check.”[5]Despite the international community’s hope for a less repressivegovernment, the pattern of abuses remained much the same.As his father had, Duvalier relied on a network of securityforces that enforced control through arbitrary arrests, which often led toprolonged, incommunicado detention, enforced disappearances, torture, andextra-judicial killings. Under Jean-Claude Duvalier’s leadership,hundreds of Haitians were victims of extrajudicial killings or otherwise diedfrom torture or as the result of inhuman detention conditions.[6]Many more were forced to flee the country, contributing to the modern Haitian diasporathat began to build under Duvalier père.As “President forlife” of Haiti, Jean-Claude Duvalier served as head of state, head ofgovernment, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces and police.[7] A report by US Senator Edward Brookefollowing a visit to Haiti in 1977 concluded that “[p]ower isconcentrated in the hands of President Duvalier and a small palaceguard.”[8] He commanded the network ofmilitary and paramilitary organizations that committed a wide range of serioushuman rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, torture,“disappearances,” and extra-judicial executions. The securityapparatus under Duvalier’s command included several overlapping andconflicting units.[9] Within the army, thereexisted five special units, the Presidential Guard, the Léopards Corps(a counterinsurgency unit), the Port-au-Prince military police, which includeda secret police, the Dessalines Battalion, and a unit at the NationalPenitentiary.[10] According to the US Embassyeach of these special units took “orders directly from thePresident.”[11] In addition six geographicalmilitary departments were under the supervision of the chief of staff who was“directly subordinate to the President for operations.”[12]The police were subordinate to the military. So-called“Section Chiefs,” deputized by the police, ruled Haiti’srural areas, where most Haitians live. As a counterweight to the army, Duvaliercontrolled a paramilitary force of some 5,000 to 7,000 irregulars called the Volontairesde la Sécurité Nationale (Volunteers for National Security or“VSN”). Duvalier claimed to have abolished the force created by hisfather, popularly known as the Tontons Macoutes (“bogeymen”in Creole) and responsible for “all but eliminat[ing] the rule of lawthrough extralegal executions, torture, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention,and other human rights abuses.”[13]In fact, Duvalier merely formally reconstituted the force under the name VSN.[14]In 1983, Human Rights Watch (then Americas Watch) found that the TontonsMacoutes continued to violate human rights in Haiti.[15]The most feared force under Duvalier, however, was thecivilian secret police, the Service Detectif (SD). Based on the grounds of thePresidential Palace, at the Casernes Dessalines, the SD were commanded by thechief of police of Port-au-Prince, who was also a member of the military, andwere responsible for the detention and interrogation of all persons suspectedof political offenses.[16]Political offences were outlawed by a 1969 anti-communistlaw, according to which all communist activity was illegal and“terrorists” were declared to be outlaws; however, the law left theterm undefined, allowing the government to selectively apply it against itscritics.[17]This law punished expression or mere profession of certain ideas, even inprivate.[18]Individuals detained according to this law were known as political prisonersbut in practice, while Duvalier’s government used the law as a cover todetain individuals, it rarely formally charged many of them, instead holdingthem incommunicado and without access to legal remedies.[19]In 1984, Duvalier’s government passed a law banning all groups which callthemselves political parties, providing security forces additional grounds forarresting and detaining prisoners for their political beliefs.[20]Since [the ‘Tontons Macoutes’]existence, this zone has become a human slaughterhouse. The abuses that have[been] perpetrated there cannot be enumerated.[21]—32citizens of Galette Potonier in a letter addressed to Duvalier, GalettePotonier, Haiti, December 1975Documenting human rightsabuses during the Duvalier government was difficult work.[22]Much of the day to day violence by the Duvalier government outside of thecapital occurred unnoticed by the international community or the few humanrights defenders that operated within Haiti, with only eight cities on thetelephone network and few roads open year round.[23]Nevertheless, information did find its way out, establishing a pattern of humanrights abuses that, most notably, included the use of a network of prisons tohold political prisoners in deplorable conditions, the use of torture againstpolitical prisoners, periodic enforced disappearances, and the systematicrepression of the free press and political opposition.a) Political Prisoners and the Triangle of DeathIt is important to understand that prisoners did not justdie of bad conditions at Fort Dimanche, rather persons were condemned to FortDimanche to slowly die of starvation, disease or diarrhea.[24]—PatrickLemoine, political prisoner arrested without charge December 19, 1971 andreleased September 21, 1977, New YorkDuvalier’s government held hundreds of politicalprisoners, often for years at a time, shuffling them through a network of threeprisons that had been established by his father: Casernes Dessalines, locatedon grounds of the presidential palace; Fort Dimanche; and the NationalPenitentiary. Together, these prisons have been referred to as the“triangle of death.” Indeed, based on assessments collected fromformer detainees, Amnesty International estimated that due to prisonconditions, disease, brutality, torture, and executions, 1 in 10 arrestedHaitians died in the first days of their detention, and 8 in 10 prisoners didnot survive more than two years.[25]Duvalier used the triangle of death to silence politicaldissent. Political prisoners imprisoned under his father remained in thenetwork, and new prisoners were arrested and entered into the system, with manydisappearing or dying due to the harsh conditions of detention.[26]Prisoners were held without access to the judicial system or to their families.Some prisoners who survived remained in detention for six or seven yearswithout charge,[27]and at least one prisoner—Claude Rosier—spent 11 years in thetriangle of death.[28]Fort Dimanche most often served as the detention facilityfor long term political prisoners, and was infamous for its inhuman conditions.Cells that measured approximately 3 meters by 3 meters held up to 33 prisonerseach, allowing each prisoner a space of only 30 centimeters.[29]Prisoners sometimes had to sleep in shifts, or in rows like sardines. Onesurvivor explained how sometimes, if a new prisoner made an odd number in thecell, the extra person would have to squeeze in on one side; with dark humorthe prisoners would joke that if they waited a few days, the problem would goaway because at least one of them would die, making the number even again.[30]Prisoners received very little food, with one prisonerestimating the ration constituted little more than 300 calories a day.[31]If and when prisoners were released, they often weighed a fraction of what theydid when they entered Fort Dimanche.[32]Sanitation was poor, and communicable diseases easily passed among prisoners,who often shared the same plate and drinking glass; approximately 18 glassesserved a population of 195 prisoners.[33]Sometimes the body stays in the cell for some hours afterthe death, until the jail officer deigns to authorize its removal. Sometimes,the prisoners are obliged to eat their meager meals over the corpse of a prisoncompanion who has just died. The dead man is rolled up in the thin straw matthat had been his bed, and is carried by the prisoners out to the brush-coveredpiece of land where common-law prisoners bury him under a thin layer of earth.It has sometimes happened that dogs eat the corpse.[34]—Testimonyof a political prisoner to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,transmitted to the government of Haiti on September 11, 1978Only one physician, Dr. Treván, was charged with themedical care of the prisoners, but his visits were limited to two or three peryear.[35]Prisoners died of pulmonary tuberculosis, diarrhea, dysentery, and otherpreventable diseases. Former prisoner Boby Duval—held incommunicado foralmost 9 months in 1977—counted 180 deaths during his detention.[36]In 1977, under pressure from abroad to clean up his humanrights record, Duvalier  said in his new year’s speech that theprotection of human rights “must not violate the respect for sovereignty,much less serve as a springboard for political maneuvering.”[37]Unfazed, US President Jimmy Carter’s administration began to pressure thegovernment to clean up its record. Besieged by telegrams and messages fromHaitians about human rights violations, including the condition of politicalprisoners,[38]United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young carried Carter’s message ofrespect for human rights to Haiti in August 1977. In a press conference, headvised that imprisoning political opponents and the use of brutality does notcontribute to the growth and development of a country, but “ultimately toits downfall.”[39]He later in his visit met one-on-one with Duvalier and reiterated this message.Young also arrived in Haiti with a list of 21 politicalprisoners.[40]According to Young, Duvalier promised he would investigate each case and findout if the person should come to trial immediately or be released.[41]Duvalier also agreed to invite an Inter-American Commission on Human Rightsdelegation to Haiti for a country visit and to restore habeus corpus andto limit detention without judicial hearing to the constitutionally permissible48 hours.[42]The United States privately believed “Duvalier [did] not intend tointroduce any significant reforms or to refrain from using arrests or thethreat of arrests to remove people he [viewed] as political threats.”[43]US intelligence recounted that the “IHaitian [sic] goverronent [sic] willnot oppose a visit by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights because itfeels that any violations of human rights or problems in that reiard [sic] canbe hidden.”[44]On September 21, 1977, Duvalier released 104 politicalprisoners and Haiti formally signed the American Convention on Human Rights.[45]In a speech the next day, he said that there remained no political prisoners inall of Haiti.[46]Duvalier also stated that he decided to release the prisoners on his own will,and that no one had asked him to do it.[47] The fate ofmissing persons, according to the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, remainedunsolved.[48]Indeed, Amnesty International quickly questioned the fate of Haitian prisonersknown still to be in detention, including Rochambeau Nestor, Ceres Daccueil,and Luc Deslmours.[49]That experience has altered my whole life.  You cannever be the same person and anything you do is in reference to thatmoment.  I have never been able to pass it.  It was a horrendousexperience.[50]—BobyDuval, political prisoner arrested April 20, 1976 and released in the amnestyof September 21, 1977, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 17, 2011After the 1977 prisoner release, the government announcedthat Fort Dimanche had been closed by order of Duvalier,[51]though the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights continued to receivedenunciations that the Fort Dimanche had not closed.[52]Political prisoners continued to be held by the Duvalier government; however,the pattern of the detention in the later years of the Duvalier regime was moretargeted to repressing the emerging free press and political oppositionmovement.b) “Disappearances” and PoliticalKillingsThe harsh conditions of the triangle of death led manyprisoners to die in prison. After their imprisonment and death, the whereaboutsof these prisoners often remained unknown to their family members. For manyfamilies whose loved ones were not on the list of prisoners Duvalier releasedin September 1977, the announcement provided confirmation that they would notbe found.While many prisoners died from the conditions in FortDimanche or the other triangle of death facilities, others were summarilyexecuted. Known executions include 11 prisoners at Fort Dimanche on August 7,1974, and the seven persons killed on March 25, 1976.[53]Summary executions allegedly occurred even as Duvalier was publicly pledgingthe respect of human rights, with eight prisoners reportedly executed at MorneChristophe and Titanyen on September 21, 1977, the same day of the release ofthe 104 prisoners.[54]“Disappearance” of political prisoners continuedin the waning years of the government. For example, Human Rights Watch (thenAmericas Watch), interviewed family members of two persons—Meres Brioleand Joseph Pardorany—“disappeared” after being arrested onSeptember 9, 1983.[55]When Human Rights Watch confronted government officials at the Haitian NationalCommission for Human Rights about the “disappearances,” it was toldthat the two people never existed and that their identities were created bysubversives.[56]Political killings reached new levels in the final months ofthe government. The murder of four students by the army at a peacefuldemonstration in Gonaives on November 28, 1985, outraged the population,setting in motion a movement to end the Duvalier government.[57]The killing sparked protests across the country and the government respondedwith force that brought international condemnation and prompted the UnitedStates to cut back its aid to Haiti.[58]On January 31, 1986, Duvalier declared a state of siege,[59]and unleashed his VSN paramilitary force (Tontons Macoutes) to terrorizethe population.[60]According to Michael S. Hooper, perhaps the leading expert on human rightsunder Duvalier, the Tontons Macoutes killed hundreds of people in thefinal days of the Duvalier government.[61] Human Rights Watchdocumented at least six people shot and killed on February 5 and 6, 1986, by a TontonMacoute in the Bel Air neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.[62]In these last days, fresh graves were found at a site near the village of BonRepos,[63]where area residents told reporters that visited in early February 1986 thattrucks had come to the site after street protests against the Duvaliergovernment.[64]c) TortureThe skin on my buttocks had been torn away. The blood wasrunning down. They weren’t put off. On the contrary, you could say thatthe sight of my blood excited them. When I was on the point of dying, theyuntied me and dragged me to a dark cell . . .[65]—EvansPaul, arrested October 16, 1980 and released October 26, 1980Torture was a regular occurrence under Duvalier. In thetransfer of detainees among triangle of death facilities, Casernes Dessalines,the army barracks located on the grounds of the presidential palace, oftenserved as the first location of detention.[66] Many politicalprisoners faced interrogation and savage torture at the Casernes Dessalinesbefore their transfer to Fort Dimanche.[67]The so-called agents of peace [the Tontons Macoutes],inflicted on him a horrible treatment: the poor man was bludgeoned; theyenjoyed pummeling his stomach with a cudgel, hitting him in the ribs. Besideswounds here and there, fractures to the spinal column were observed, and thepoor man succumbed in excruciating pain on November 4 at 8 am in publicview.  All this happened because he had not what it takes to buy hisfreedom.[68]—32citizens of Galette Poonier in a letter addressed to Duvalier, GalettePotonier, Haiti, December 1975Some well-known cases include the torture of Sylvio Claudeduring his 1979 arrest, when security forces applied electric shocks to hisfeet,[69]and of Richard Brisson after the November 28, 1980 raids on activists.[70]Shortly after the raids, Lafontant Joseph, a lawyer and secretary general ofthe Ligue Haitienne des droits humains, the Haitian Human Rights League, wasforcibly arrested and reportedly severely tortured.[71]In November 1981, several members of the Autonomous Federation of HaitianWorkers (Central Autonome des Travailleurs Haitiens or CATH) and other workersdemonstrating outside the Palais de Justice were also reportedly detained,taken to Casernes Dessalines, and tortured.[72]Prisoners who had beentortured recounted a similar method of torture, called the djak inHaitian Creole: as already described, their hands were tied behind their legs,and a stick or bar was then pushed between their legs and arms.[73]The prisoners tied in this position would be drawn into a ball around thestick, and from that position, they would be beaten with sticks.[74]d) Repression of the Press and Political DissentDuvalier’s government severely restricted freedoms ofassociation, assembly, and expression through its complex network of military,paramilitary, and police forces, which worked to silence independent oropposition voices. The government repeatedly closed independent newspapers andradio stations. Journalists were beaten, jailed, and forced to leave thecountry. Despite promises of liberalization by Duvalier, the physical assaultand arrest in December 1977 of Bob Nuree, editor of the opposition weekly JeunePresse, made clear that any steps by the government towards liberalizationhad been cosmetic.[75]By September 1979, newspapers reported that “Duvalierterror” gripped Haiti, and that Duvalier had unleashed the TontonsMacoutes “as a warning to all.”[76]In the first three weeks of September 1979, 200 people were reportedly arrestedand the secret police had seized, beaten, and jailed leaders of two newlyemerged political parties.[77]According to newspaper reports, the government also forbade “theincreasingly independent press and radio to report the arrests and any morecomplaints about killings and brutality of the Macoutes through thecountry.”[78]Duvalier also reportedly called on his VSN paramilitary force to be“ready to fight to defend” his government.[79]In a September 22, 1979 speech commemorating the 22nd anniversary of theDuvalier regime, Duvalier stated that he would not tolerate subversivecritique.[80]On the same day, he referred to the VSN as his “first line ofdefense,”[81]saying “[m]en and women of the militia, you are the linchpin of mygovernment, the major force on which I base myself.”[82]Prompted by concerns about Duvalier’s new rhetoric,the Haitian Human Rights League held a meeting to discuss the status of humanrights in Haiti on November 9, 1979.[83]In what became known as “Black Friday,” a unit of TontonsMacoutes,[84]carrying guns, knives, and iron bars[85]and shouting “Jean-Claude Duvalier,”[86]violently broke up the meeting, attacking some in attendance, including envoysfrom the United States, France, Canada, and West Germany.[87]United States political officer Ints Silins was slapped sharply across theface.[88]The head of the human rights league, Gerard Gourgue, and his wife and daughterwere beaten and Georges Michel, a journalist for Radio Metropole, washospitalized with head injuries.[89]A government communiqué regretted the incident, which it blamed on“a fight between those present ... as a result of opinions issued inintroductory remarks which were not shared by the audience,” but deniedany involvement in it.[90]In the remaining years of the Duvalier government, theregime used increasing repression to contain the growing opposition and freepress.  In 1980, the press law was amended to “provide for prisonsentences of one to three years for members of the press engaged in‘offending the Chief of State or the First Lady of the Republic,’or ‘making any attack against the integrity of the people’sculture.’”[91]This law also required that journalists be licensed through the minister of theinterior, and that all publications be submitted for censorship to the InteriorMinistry 72 hours in advance.[92]After the November 28, 1980 round-up, the repression of thepress continued. In 1982, a newscaster for Radio Metropole was forced todiscontinue his broadcasts and a group of journalists trying to produce apolitical newsletter was arrested, interrogated, and provided a warning thatthey should discontinue such attempts.[93] Minister ofInterior Roger Lafontant issued a communiqué in 1984 to remind the pressthat they were required to obtain authorization to establish new publicationsand failure to observe the procedures provided for in the press law wouldresult in a government ban of their publication.[94]Despite these warnings, the press attempted to continuecovering riots over food shortages that broke out in several cities in 1984,[95]but several journalists were rounded-up, arrested, interrogated, and in somecases tortured.[96]In one instance, police interrogated for 40 hours, beat, and broke the fingersof Pierre Robert Auguste, an editor of a local newspaper, in the presence ofthe minister of the interior and the chief of police.[97]At the end of 1984, approximately 35 intellectuals who spoke against thecorruption of the government were rounded up and imprisoned, held withoutcharge, and finally released in April 1985.[98] The conditions ofimprisonment were little improved from the period of time when scores ofprisoners died in Fort Dimanche. One imprisoned doctor was beaten to the pointof loss of consciousness for trying to treat a fellow prisoner with agastrointestinal illness.[99]November 28, 1980:  Duvalier and the Arrest,Torture, and Expulsion of Journalists and ActivistsThe eventsof November 28, 1980, when security forces arrested hundreds of journalistsand opposition voices—torturing several of them—illustrateDuvalier’s personal role in crimes committed by his government.A period ofliberalization under Duvalier had allowed for the development of independentjournalism, a few opposition parties, and a human rights league,[100] but signs of a coming repressionbegan to gather in early fall 1980, with the October 13th arrest of Sylvio Claude, head ofthe Christian Democratic Party,[101] and of Anthony“Konpe-Filo” Pascal, a journalist with Radio Haiti Inter, and thesubsequent arrest of Ivens Paul, playwright and station announcer for RadioCacique on October 16, 1980.[102]The election of Ronald Reagan as president of the United States inNovember 1980 changed the political calculation for Duvalier. The night ofReagan’s election, gunshots from the celebrating Tontons Macoutescould be heard across Port-au-Prince[103] and theDuvaliers threw a lavish gala to celebrate Jimmy Carter’s defeat.[104] A US official claimed that“Haitians felt free to act when Carter lost.”[105]On November 28, 1980, Haiti “inaugurated the most widespreadcampaign to repress dissent since the days of “Papa Doc,”Francois Duvalier, almost a decade [before].”[106] The day beganwith the disappearance of several journalists at Radio Haiti Inter. RichardBrisson, the program manager at Radio Haiti Inter did not show up to work andstation manager Jean Dominique had not returned from running an errand.[107] Radio Haiti Inter began tobroadcast the disappearances, asking for information about the whereabouts ofBrisson and Dominique.[108] In early afternoon,suddenly the airwaves at Haiti Radio Inter were filled with commotion, asplainclothes officers raided the station.  A recording played over andover again for 30 minutes, and then the broadcast went silent.[109] The only sound that could be heardemanating from the station was the methodic click of a skipping recordplayer, as security forces took everyone in the station into several vansthat transported them to Casernes Dessalines, on the grounds of thepresidential palace.[110] By the end ofthe day, between 100 and 400 human rights defenders, opposition politicalmembers, and journalists had been arrested throughout Port-au-Prince.[111] In one sweep, the democratic movementin Haiti was crushed.[112]Theconditions of detention were harsh. Stripped of their clothing, detaineessecretly communicated with each from their small cells, trying to piecetogether information about what was occurring.[113] One by one, the detainees werecalled in for questioning by Chief of Police Colonel Jean Valmé, MajorEmmanuel Orcel, and Colonel Albert Pierre, widely known as “TiBoulé,” with Valmé conducting the questioning.[114]As they waited their turn, they could hear thescreams of other detainees being tortured.[115]The detainees were held incommunicado without accessto legal counsel or to their families.[116]Aneditorial by the Ministry of Information ran the next morning in the NouveauMonde; entitled “The plot will not succeed,” it was a warningto “troublemakers” that the “interests of the nation willprevail.”[117]On November 30, Colonel Jean Valmé issued astatement about the arrests in which he announced the dismantling of a vastcommunist plot:National and international Communist agitators connected with the mediahave been carrying out subversive activities for several months both in thecapital and certain provincial towns in order to create a climate suitablefor the perpetration of terrorist and criminal acts… Faithful to itsduty of ensuring the security of lives and property, the police have, in aseries of raids, succeeded in dismantling a network of agitators, some ofwhom have now gone into clandestinity…[118]In aninterview years after the events, Valmé reportedly asserted thatDuvalier told him to “do what you want with these journalists.”[119] Valmé did not fullyunderstand the order, and sought clarification from Henri Bayard, Minister ofthe Presidency.[120] Bayard reportedly told him to"do [his] job” and “[a]rrest them.”[121] He also told Valmé not toworry, “if they did nothing, the president would release them”the following Monday.On December4, the pro-government newspaper Le Nouveau Monde ran a headlinecelebrating the arrests; “[t]hey failed in their criminal attempt, therevolution continues its triumphal march.”[122] Under this headline an officialbulletin was published announcing “the dismantling of a network ofcommunist agitators,”[123] and another editorial byDuvalier’s information ministry warning youth about the“trap” of subversive ideas. The editorial refers to the“revolution’s” disarmament of conspiratorial andreactionary groups and cautions that those of mature age must be vigilant andprotect youth from being manipulated by ideologues. It is for this reason,the editorial claimed, that the government must censure the behavior of thosewho unpatriotically lead youth away from their vocation as citizens.[124]The same front page reproduced a communiquéfrom the secretary of state for social affairs inviting citizens to a rallyto support Duvalier on December 4, 1980.[125]At the rally on December 4, Duvaliervigorously defended his actions, saying that there were Haitians who had“forgotten” all that he had done to liberalize the country.[126]He warned activists that, “theymust respect [his] power, as my power will respect them.”[127]Alluding to the arrests, he said that“he did not lose his cool,” but that it was a moment in which onehad to act.[128]In an interview published on December 8, Duvalier told the New YorkTimes that the arrests were necessary for the security of the government,stating “wewere obliged to act for the simple reason most ofthese people were implicated in a conspiracy against the security of theGovernment…Politics is not a matter for children, [s]ometimes you haveto act even if it is against your feelings.”[129]In an interviewwith a Haitian paper the next day, Duvalier reiterated that “thegovernment did not act lightly” (“n’a pas agi à lalégère”) in imprisoning and expelling the dissidents.[130]By January1981, 17 of the journalists that had been arrested were forcibly exiled, and26 more were charged with acts of terrorism.[131] Several of those arrested hadsuffered severe beatings and torture, including journalist Richard Brissonand Lafontant Joseph, a human rights activist.[132]An unnamed journalist was so badly beaten around the head, with his handstied behind his legs, that upon his return to his cell, he was semi-consciousand unable to stand.[133]I was taken. . .to Casernes Dessalines where we were interrogatedunder torture. . . I was kept […] hidden below the Palais National,where there is no daylight. Thanks to the electric torch of the prison guard,however, I was able to distinguish skeletons, probably those of formerprisoners, lying there on the ground. It was like living a nightmare inside amass grave under the Palais National.[134]—Yves Richard, Secretary General of CATH, arrested November 28, 1980,date and location of testimony unknowne) The Need to Investigate Sexual andGender—Based ViolenceTestimonial evidence from female victims of Duvalier shouldbe collected to determine whether violations also included sexual violence. TheTontons Macoutes under Duvalier-père were widely believed to usesexual violence against women as a means to humiliate women and their husbandsinto submission to the regime, without facing punishment. In some instances inthat earlier period, parents would not allow their daughters to go to publicareas where Macoutes were known to be, because “if a Macoute decidedhe wanted a girl, he would have her.”[135]There is anecdotal evidence that politically motivatedsexual crimes continued under Jean-Claude Duvalier. In 1981, AmnestyInternational reported that one female refugee living in France claimed thatshe had been detained after refusing to have sexual relations with a TontonMacoute.[136]And what we know of Duvalier government treatment of female political prisonersshould give pause. Female prisoners held in the Casernes Dessalines, forexample, recount that they were forced to walk in only their panties to thewashroom, walking through the barracks exposed.[137]While male prisoners were also forced to walk in their underwear, the nakednessof female prisoners in front of all-male military police guards andmajority-male prisoners was a form of sexual humiliation.The issue merits furtherinvestigation because, while there is little documentation of Duvalier-erasexual crimes at present, it was not standard practice at the time for humanrights organizations or even journalists to report on sexual violence as ahuman rights violation.[138]III. The Proceedings against DuvalierShortly after Duvalier fled the country in 1986, the newgovernment established a commission to investigate the financial corruption ofthe Duvalier government and later instituted criminal proceedings againstDuvalier for financial crimes. In 2008, another investigation was opened andincluded crimes against persons. The government re-instituted these pendingcases when Duvalier returned in January 2011. Under Haitian law and proceduralrules, the government has until May 19, 2011, to complete its investigation andcharge Duvalier.The 1986 proceedings began on April 18, 1986, when the stateprosecutor (Commissaire du gouvernement), Ulrick Rosarion, issued instructionsfor the investigation of members of the Duvalier government, referred to as the“Duvalier criminal organization.” Investigating judge (juged’instruction) Emmanuel Dutreiuil was assigned to the case. The sameyear, cases were instituted against several of the members of his government,including Luc Desir, an official in Duvalier’s government who also servedas chief of the secret police under Duvalier-père, for crimes includingmurder and torture. On January 15, 1987, the governor of the Bank of theRepublic of Haiti issued a report concluding that sufficient evidence existedthat Duvalier alone stole over $120,000,000 from the public coffers of Haitiand that members of his family and government stole hundreds of millions ofdollars more.On June 9, 1999, a supplemental instruction enumerating theallegations in the original 1986 instruction was sent to a new investigatingjudge on the case, Pierre Josiard Agnant, who brought charges against Duvalierand Frantz Merceron for bribery and corruption, Duvalier’s wife MichèleDuvalier for corruption and as an accomplice to bribery, and several othernamed defendants for corruption.[139]On April 29, 2008, another investigation against Duvalier was opened by thestate prosecutor (Commissaire du gouvernement), Claudy Gassant; it included theallegations of financial crimes and added crimes against persons, includingpotential crimes against humanity. This case was referred to investigatingjudge (juged’instruction) Bernard Saint Vil, and was open when Duvalierreturned to Haiti after his 25-year exile.Commissaire du gouvernement Harycidas Auguste re-institutedthis pending criminal case when Duvalier returned in January 2011. Saint Vilwas no longer available to handle the case, and it was referred toinvestigating judge Carvés Jean on January 19, 2011, with instructionsto investigate both alleged financial crimes and crimes against persons,including murder, torture, arbitrary detention, and disappearances. On January19, 2011, Duvalier submitted to questioning on corruption and embezzlementallegedly committed during his 15-year rule. In addition, several victims ofthe Duvalier government came forward and filed complaints with the government.Their complaints formed the basis of further instructions by the commissaire toinvestigate Duvalier for human rights violations, including crimes againsthumanity. As of March 28, 2011, 16 Haitian victims of Duvalier had filedcomplaints with the state prosecutor related to crimes against humanity andhuman rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, andenforced disappearances.[140]The procedural clock for the investigation began on January19, 2011, giving the investigating judge three months to determine whethercharges should be brought against Duvalier. The investigating judge may requestan additional month, though these time limits are rarely adhered to inpractice. During this time, the judge may call in witnesses and carry out otherinvestigative acts.  As of March 19, 2011, a number of victims had beenbrought before the judge for questioning, as well as two former financeministers. At the end of the investigative period, the investigating judge willissue a notification to the commissaire (“Soit communiqué”),alerting him that the investigation is complete.  The commissaire may thenprovide the judge with a final resubmission (“Requisitoiredefinitif”) on the charges. The judge will consider the evidence and willultimately decide if charges will be brought.IV. Theories of Duvalier’s LiabilityHuman Rights Watch is not aware of any evidence thatDuvalier was present when the murders, torture, “disappearances,”or arbitrary detentions took place. However, under international and Haitianlaw, senior leaders ­can be prosecuted for the acts of their subordinatesin a number of ways.a) Investigating Duvalier as anAccomplice to Crimes Committed by His GovernmentA senior leader may be responsible if prosecutors can provea causal link between his orders and crimes against civilians committed by histroops. Liability can also arise if a leader instigated, aided, or abetted thecommission of crimes.Under Haitian criminal law,[141]a person can be tried and punished as an accomplice when three conditionsexist: first, a principal act, i.e., a predicate crime; second, an actof complicity before or concomitant with the commission of the predicate crime;and, third, mens rea, or knowing participation in the criminal activity.The code distinguishes between three types of complicity. The first iscomplicity by instigation and can take the form of direct provocation throughinstructions, promises, threats, and the like; the second type is by procuringthe means for the crime; and, the third, aiding and abetting.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) hasfound that assistance or encouragement alone may be sufficient to establishindividual responsibility.[142]The ICTR also found that aiding and abetting are distinct juridical concepts.[143]It has also held that the presence of the accomplice at the crime is not required.[144]In addition, the act of aiding or abetting can occur through failure to act ifthe omission has a decisive effect on the perpetration of the crime or isaccompanied by the requisite intent or mens rea.[145]The accomplice does not, however, need to share the same intent or mens reaas the primary author of the crime; rather, the intent “requirement will be satisfied where an individual acts intentionallyand with the awareness that he is influencing or assisting the principal perpetrator to commit the crime.”[146] In addition, the mens rea can be establishedcircumstantially, including with evidence of prior like behavior, failure topunish, or verbal encouragement.[147]When Duvaliercame to power, Haiti’s constitution named the president the supreme chiefand leader of the Armed Forces and VSN, and granted the president all power tocommand them.[148] The 1983 constitution confirmed thispower.[149] Many of the acts of torture andarbitrary attention occurred on the very grounds of the Presidential Palace, inthe Casernes Dessalines.Duvalier’s public speeches and acts have alluded tohis control over the state apparatuses perpetuating these crimes. In a speechon June 22, 1971 in front of Fort Dimanche, he said that  he was "thesupreme and de facto Leader of the Armed Forces, Police Forces and the NationalSecurity Volunteers [Tontons Macoutes]," and that he was "nowthe only Supervisor of the Militia." He also warned that "people whoopenly or stealthily try to block the path of our Revolution will besystematically carried and swept away by this great force of history."[150]At the September 21, 1977 release of 104 prisoners, Duvalier stated that therelease of prisoners was his decision to make.[151]In December 1980, after the round-up and torture of journalists and politicalopposition, Duvalier said baldly “we were obliged to act.”In that case, his police chief reportedly said that Duvalier told him to“do what you want with these journalists.”[152]Duvalier is alleged to have ordered the detention of businessman Lucien Rigaudin the National Penitentiary.[153]The chief of state must do everything. He is like thefather of a family who must take care of everyone. . .[154]—Jean-ClaudeDuvalier, President of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, June 30, 1981In addition to public speeches and acts of Duvalier,evidence of “insiders,” those who worked in Duvalier’ssystem, will be critical to detail Duvalier’s exact role. Importantinsiders who are alive today include Colonel Jean Valmé, director of thesecret police and chief of the Port-au-Prince police, and Emmanuel Orcel. Bothhave been identified in human rights reports and by victims as perpetrators oftorture and arbitrary arrests.b) Investigating Duvalier forCrimes Committed under His Command ResponsibilityDuvalier may also be liable under the customaryinternational law doctrine of “command responsibility” or“superior responsibility” which holds that individuals who are incivilian or military authority may under certain circumstances be criminallyliable not solely for their own actions but also for the crimes of those undertheir authority.[155]This principle of liability was applied by Haitian courts in the prosecution ofthe April 1994 Raboteau massacre[156]and resulted in the conviction of a number of superiors including RaoulCédras, the leader of the 1991-1994 military junta and Emmanuel“Toto” Constant, the founder of the paramilitary organization the Frontfor the Advancement and Progress of Haiti.[157]Three elements are needed to establish liability forcriminal acts pursuant to the doctrine of command or superior responsibility:Theremust be a superior-subordinate relationship.Thesuperior must have known or had reason to know that the subordinate was aboutto commit a crime or had committed a crime.Thesuperior failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the crimeor to punish the perpetrator.[158]In the Raboteau case, the court found that these elementsresulted in a “crime by omission.”[159]1. The Superior-Subordinate RelationshipA superior-subordinate relationship is clearest when thereare formal rules, for example when legislation or a military chain of commandspecifies the existence of a relationship. However, even in the absence offormal rules, a superior can have actual and effective control.[160]Thus, civilian and political superiors, as well as those in military command,may be held liable under this doctrine.[161]As president, Duvalier exerted de jure and defacto command and control over the army, police, and other irregularsecurity forces,[162]which committed arbitrary arrests, torture, “disappearances,” andexecutions. These groups reported directly to Duvalier.[163]The state-run prison Fort Dimanche—where prisoners died fromtorture—was run by the army.[164]2. The Superior’s KnowledgeA superior’s knowledge can be proveneither by showing he had “actual knowledge” that hissubordinates were committing or about to commit crimes or that he had“reason to know” that his subordinates were about to commit or hadcommitted crimes.[165]While the fact that a superior had actual knowledge may beproven through direct evidence, it may—and often is—alsoestablished through circumstantial evidence, i.e., evidence from which aninference can be made that the superior “must have known” ofsubordinates’ criminal acts.[166]Such evidence can include the number, type, and scope of illegal acts, timeduring which the illegal acts occurred, whether the occurrence of the acts iswidespread, the modus operandi of similar illegal acts, and the officersand staff involved.[167]International tribunals have also found that a superior’s knowledge maybe presumed if a superior had means to obtain information of a crime anddeliberately refrained from doing so.[168]The “had reason to know” standard does notrequire that the superior had actual knowledge but requires only that he had someinformation available to him that would have put him on notice of crimes.[169]General information about the possibility of crimes is all that is necessary,not that he have explicit or specific details of them[170]and that information could be available in many different forms, such asthrough a specific report or other written format, or even orally.[171] The key question is whether the superior is in possession of theinformation, not whether he acquainted himself with it[172]because a superior may not remain “willfully blind” to the acts ofsubordinates.[173]As described above, the crimes under Duvalier’s rulewere sufficiently notorious that he “must haveknown” about them.  And if not, he was personally put onnotice repeatedly by, among others:US Ambassador Andrew Young, who raised human rights issues withDuvalier  in August 1977 and presented him with a list of 21 politicalprisoners;US Senator Edward Brooke, who discussed human rights withDuvalier in April 1974[174]and 1977. Duvalier ordered a 1974 report by Brooke on the human rightssituation in Haiti to be circulated to all cabinet members.[175]In the 1977 conversation “[Brooke] stressed the need for the GOH to moverapidly to improve its record regarding respect for human rights.”[176]According to Brooke, “[Duvalier] said that he was aware of the seriousproblems in this area and was moving to rectify them. As proof of the latter hementioned that the attempt was being made to improve the situation of prisonersby the construction of a new and modern prison to replace the presentfacilities of the ancient Fort Dimanche.”[177]Various public releases of prisoners that Duvalierpersonally oversaw indicate that he had full knowledge of the imprisonment ofpolitical dissenters. He was also put on notice by international actors abouthis human rights record. For example, in 1974, a United States Senatesubcommittee charged that the government of Haiti continued the practice ofDuvalier père and held political prisoners and engaged in politicalrepression.[178]When US Senator Edward W. Brooke met with Duvalier in April 1974, Duvalierattempted to rebut allegations in the report, which he had read.[179]Duvalier claimed that Haiti, unlike other Latin American countries, had nopolitical prisoners.[180]In direct contradiction of this, in September 1974, “about a dozen ofHaiti’s most prominent political prisoners, after being held for twoyears without trial, [were] sentenced to life imprisonment by a secret militarycourt. . .”[181]Over the next few years, Duvalier pardoned over 100 political prisoners,[182]again contradicting his assertions. Although Duvalier issued public amnestiesin the succeeding years,[183]the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was able to send the government anote on September 11, 1978, with a list of 151 individuals who, according tothe allegations of accusers, were executed while in prison or who died inprison between 1974 and 1977 because of lack of medical care.[184]3. Superior Duty to Take Necessary and Reasonable Measuresto Prevent the Crime and to Punish the PerpetratorSuperiors have both a duty to prevent and a duty to punishthe crimes of subordinate persons. These constitute distinct and independentlegal obligations, but they are not alternative obligations, i.e., a superiorwho has reason to know of a crime to be committed cannot wait until the crimeis committed and then impose punishment.[185]Superiors successfully discharge their duty to prevent subordinate crimes whenthey employ all means materially available to them to do so.[186]A superior’s “duty to punish” arises afterthe commission of an offense, and includes at least an obligation toinvestigate possible crimes, to establish the facts, and to take steps toensure that the perpetrators are sanctioned.[187] Both the criminalcrimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have held that evidenceof failure to punish may arise from failure to create or sustain an environmentof discipline and respect for the law.[188]Human Rights Watch knows of no evidence that Duvalier tooksteps to prevent or stem any of the crimes described in this report or that anyof their direct perpetrators were punished.V. Haitihas a Duty to Investigate and Punish Duvalier’s Alleged CrimesDuvalier’s allegedcrimes, including murder, torture, and sequestration, are serious crimes underHaitian law. These crimes were committed as part of a state apparatus underDuvalier’s command. Under international law, which is binding on Haitiand has been incorporated into Haitian law, Haiti has a duty to investigate andpunish perpetrators of serious human rights abuses, a duty which cannot beundermined by statutes of limitations, amnesties, or other domestic legalobstacles. In addition, crimes committed as part of systematic or generalizedattacks against civilian populations constitute crimes against humanity.[189]Article 466 of the Haitian penal code provides a 10-yearlimitations period from the date of the commission of the crime for theprosecution for most of Duvalier’s alleged crimes. After the fall of theDuvalier government, a decree was adopted on June 18, 1986, to extend thestatute of limitations for crimes against persons (including homicide, murder,rape, false arrest, and illegal imprisonment) committed under the 25-year Duvalierregime (from October 22, 1957 to February 7, 1986) to 10-years from the date ofthe decree, thus allowing for investigation and prosecution of all Duvalier-eracrimes (Duvalier-pere as well as Jean-Claude Duvalier) through June 18, 1996.[190]Duvalier’s lawyers and former Minister of Justice Bernard Gousse arguethat this decree prevents the current investigation and prosecution of Duvaliersince that date is now past.[191]This interpretation fails to consider Haiti’s international human rightsobligations and to consider the jurisprudence that defines some of the allegedcrimes, namely “disappearances,” to becontinuing crimes, and therefore, the statute does not run until the crime iscompleted (i.e. the victim's whereabouts determined).a) Haiti’s International Obligation toInvestigate Serious Violations of Human Rights or Crimes against HumanityPrevails over Any Statute of LimitationsArticle 276 (2) of the Haitian Constitution states:Les Traités ou AccordInternationaux, une fois sanctionnés et ratifiés dans les formesprévues par la Constitution, font partie de la Législation duPays et abrogent toutes les Lois qui leur sont contraires.Once international treaties or agreements are approved andratified in the manner stipulated by the Constitution, they become part of thelegislation of the country and abrogate any laws in conflict with them.[192]Thus, duly ratified international treaties trump any conflicting laws. Haiti is a party to atleast two human rights treaties, the American Convention on Human Rights andthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which imposeobligations on party states to investigate and punish perpetrators of serioushuman rights abuses.Haiti became a party to the American Convention on HumanRights in 1977. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights,whose interpretations of the convention are authoritative and binding on Haiti,has held repeatedly that in light of states’ obligations to investigate and prosecute crimes under the convention, statutesof limitations are inadmissible in connection with gross human rightsviolations proscribed by international law. The court has ruled that “allamnesty provisions, provisions on prescription and the establishment ofmeasures designed to eliminate responsibility are inadmissible under theconvention, because they are intended to prevent the investigation andpunishment of those responsible for serious human rights violations such astorture, extra-legal, summary or arbitrary execution and forced disappearance, allof them prohibited because they violate non-derogable rights recognized byinternational human rights law.”[193] Thus, as thecrimes allegedly committed by Duvalier constitute serious violations of humanrights, they cannot be prescribed by domestic law.Moreover, since 1946,various international instruments have reaffirmed that those responsible forcrimes against humanity must be punished and that states should not enactlegislative or other measures, such as statutes of limitations, to preventfulfillment of the international obligation to prosecute persons alleged tohave committed crimes against humanity.Indeed, the Conventionon the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations on War Crimes and CrimesAgainst Humanity (1970) was adopted just prior to Jean-Claude Duvalier assumingpower, and the European Convention on the Non-Applicability of StatutoryLimitations on War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity (1974) was adoptedshortly thereafter. Both treaties set out the principle that there is no time limitto prosecute crimes against humanity, a principle that is codified in Article29 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.While Haiti has not ratified any international treaty onstatutory limitations, these instruments are evidence of state practice and opiniojuris that statutes of limitations should not be interpreted to barprosecution of crimes against humanity. The Inter-American Court of HumanRights, a body by whose judgments Haiti is legally bound, has also affirmedthat crimes against humanity are not susceptible to application of statutes oflimitation.[194]In that case the court held that a murder carried out in 1973 should be subjectto prosecution notwithstanding that Chile only became a party to the Court in1990, on the grounds that in 1973 murder committed in the course of ageneralized or systematic attack against certain sectors of the civilpopulation was a crime against humanity and therefore in violation of a bindingrule of international law at the time. As the prohibition to commit crimesagainst humanity is a jus cogens rule, the punishment of such crimes isobligatory pursuant to the general principles of international law and statutesof limitations are not applicable.b) The Continuous Nature of“Disappearances” and False Imprisonment Prevent PrescriptionAs described above, many people taken away byDuvalier’s forces were never heard from again. The United Nations WorkingGroup on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has recorded a number of casesdating from the 1981-1985 period: in none of the cases have officialsacknowledged the detainee’s wrongful deprivation of liberty let alonedisclosed their fate or whereabouts. According to the working group,“most of the cases that occurred during the [1981-1985] period concernedmembers or supporters of the Haitian Christian Democrat Party who wereallegedly arrested by members of the Armed Forces or by the Tontons Macoutes.”[195]Under both French law—on which Haitian law isbased—and international law, the statute of limitations for such actsdoes not begin to run until the crime has finished, i.e., until the detainedperson is released or his whereabouts are clarified.Haitian law, like French law, punishes the crime of “sequestration,”[196]which may be translated as “false imprisonment.” The FrenchCour de cassation (Supreme Court) has consistently held that “sequestration”is a “continuing crime.”[197] For such a crime,the statute of limitations only begins when all the elements of the crime havebeen completed—i.e., the victim has been released or his fate clarified.[198]In the cases filed in France on behalf of disappeared French victims ofChile’s Augusto Pinochet, the trial judge ruled that the statute oflimitations could not run as long as the victims’ whereabouts were unknown.[199]Even in the case of murder, the statute of limitations only begins when thedate and the cause of the victims’ death are known.[200]Similarly, international law criminalizes “enforceddisappearances,” defined as the “arrest, detention, abduction or anyother form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons orgroups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of theState, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or byconcealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which placesuch a person outside the protection of the law.”[201]The UN Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearancestates that “Acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be considereda continuing offence as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the fateand the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remainunclarified.”[202]The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or InvoluntaryDisappearances, in a recent General Comment, noted that “[e]nforceddisappearances are prototypical continuous acts. The act begins at the time ofthe abduction and extends for the whole period of time that the crime is notcomplete, that is to say until the State acknowledges the detention or releasesinformation pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the individual.” Asa result, said the working group:“As far as possible, tribunals and other institutionsought to give effect to enforced disappearance as a continuing crime or humanright violation for as long as all elements of the crime or the violation arenot complete.”“Where a statute or rule of procedure seems tonegatively affect the continuous violation doctrine, the competent body oughtto construe such a provision as narrowly as possible so that a remedy isprovided or persons prosecuted for the perpetration of thedisappearance.”[203]The declaration also provides that “All States shouldtake any lawful and appropriate action available to them to bring to justiceall persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced disappearance, who arefound to be within their jurisdiction or under their control.”[204]The Inter-American Courtof Human Rights has also recognized the permanent and continuous nature offorced disappearances. Since its judgment in the VelásquezRodríguez case in 1988, the court has consistently reiterated that“[t]he forced disappearance of human beings is a multiple and continuousviolation of many rights under the convention that the States Parties areobligated to respect.”[205] A similar understanding ofthe nature of forced disappearances is reflected in national case law in theAmericas: courts in Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuelahave treated forced disappearances as continuous offences and crimes againsthumanity.[206] The Supreme Court of Mexicoruled, for instance, that the statute of limitations should be calculated onlyfrom the time the victim’s remains are found.[207]In Chilean cases involving General Augusto Pinochet, the Supreme Court and theCourt of Appeal of Santiago established the non-applicability of statutes oflimitations.[208]Thus, because of the continuous nature of the crime, theallegations against Duvalier for “disappearances” are notprescribed by any domestic Haitian law, including the 1986 decree.VI.Institutional Challenges Facing the ProsecutionAs described above, international law requires that Haitiinvestigate and prosecute Duvalier’s crimes.  The investigation andtrial of a former head of state for mass crimes committed between 25 and 40years ago will be a complex endeavor. Further complicating the issue are thechallenges currently facing the Haitian judicial system. The infrastructure,already weak, was further weakened by the January 2010 earthquake. Few judicialresources exist to dedicate to this case. The Haitian judiciary and bar havelittle experience or expertise in prosecutions of this nature. And all actorsin the case, including witnesses, victims, judicial officers, and thedefendant, face possible harassment and in some cases possible physicalviolence that require attention from Haitian authorities.a) Weak Capacity Can be Bolstered by InternationalSupportThe Haitian legal system will have difficulty pursuing thecase without international support. Even before the earthquake, the Haitianjudicial system struggled to handle basic criminal cases, let alone complextrials involving a former head of state. According to a pre-earthquake UNreport,Arbitrary arrests, unlawful police custody, ill-treatmentand excessive use of force continue to be reported. Lack of technicalexpertise, poor communication, negligence and apparent corruption of judicialauthorities are reportedly the source of numerous unlawful arrests, prolongedpre-trial detention and a low number of court decisions. Public distrust of thejustice system has led many Haitians to avoid the formal court system and relyon informal methods, such as vigilantism, which further undermines the securitysituation.[209]Haiti's earthquake has further diminished the capacity ofthe state and has almost totally undermined its ability to safeguardfundamental rights. Chronic problems such as violence against women andinhumane prison conditions have been exacerbated. Most of those who escapedfrom jail during the earthquake (almost none of whom had ever been tried)remain at large.[210]The failures of reconstruction and confused elections have further erodedgovernment legitimacy.Special Advisor to the President of Haiti for Legal Affairs RenéMagloire stated clearly: “the Haitian judicial system—and I thinkthat this is no secret—is very weak.”[211]Nevertheless, with concerted international efforts, aprosecution of Duvalier in Haiti could kick-start rule of law efforts and helpto begin building the state institutions that Haitians deserve. Trying these complex cases demands special expertise ininvestigating mass violations, understanding the criminal network that led totheir commission, and building the links between Duvalier and other seniorofficials and those officers or agents who committed crimes on the ground. Itrequires among other things, protecting prosecution and defence witnesses, andproviding adequate security for those involved in proceedings. Enhancingnational capacity to address the most serious crimes underinternational criminal law thus has the potential to significantly advancebroader judicial reform efforts and both merits and requires targeted fundingand assistance from international donors.Resources must also be available to ensure Duvalier’sright to a fair trial. The Haitian constitution enshrines basic due processrights, including the right to a fair trial, as does the American Convention onHuman Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR). Under Article 14 of the ICCPR, Duvalier has a number of fair trialrights, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; theright to be informed promptly and in detail of the nature and cause of thecharges against him; the right to adequate time and facilities to prepare hisdefense and communicate with a lawyer of his choosing; the right to be triedwithout undue delay; and the right not to be compelled to testify againsthimself or to confess guilt. Any trial of Duvalier should ensure that theserights are scrupulously protected.b) Limited Resources can be Used EfficientlyAn investigation and prosecution of this kind requiressignificant human resources. Currently, only one juge d’instruction andone prosecutor are assigned to the case. The government should considerassigning additional personnel to the Duvalier dossier. Under Haitian law it isnot unprecedented to have more than one investigative judge assigned to a case.The government’s limited resources can be maximized todevelop a targeted and efficient prosecution strategy. Though his allegedcrimes may be extensive and varied, the government should not attempt toprosecute Duvalier for all of the alleged crimes of his regime. A betterstrategy for the prosecution of Duvalier would be to focus on charges that arerepresentative of Duvalier’s alleged gravest crimes for which thereexists a strong evidentiary basis.[212]The prosecution should also ensure that its strategyincludes adequate focus on evidence about the chain of command. It will bevitally important to balance testimony from victims and witnesses to establishwhat crimes took place with sufficient with evidence to establishDuvalier’s control over the official and unofficialsecurity forces that committed such serious crimes as well as his knowledge ofthe crimes.[213]c) Lack of Technical Expertise Can be Addressed withExpert SupportMass human rights violations presume a criminal network thatfacilitates the widespread commission of crimes, in Duvalier’s case anetwork of official and unofficial security forces. Uncovering this criminalnetwork to prove the links between Duvalier and his forces on the ground willrequire significant effort and expertise. While there are many skilled juristsin Haiti, they do not have the experience, and thus, at present, the expertiseto pursue this type of investigation and prosecution. Special Advisor to thePresident of Haiti on Legal Affairs René Magloire noted that“[t]his is the first time a case on crimes against humanity will bebefore the Haitian courts.”[214]On February 1, 2011, United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights Navi Pillay “offered the authorities in Haiti technicalassistance towards the prosecution of crimes committed under the leadership ofJean Claude Duvalier.” According to Pillay:Haiti has an obligation to investigate the well-documentedserious human rights violations that occurred during the rule of Mr. Duvalier,and to prosecute those responsible for them . . . Such systematic violations ofrights cannot remain unaddressed. The thousands of Haitians who suffered underthis regime deserve justice. I call on the Haitian authorities to send amessage to the world that their national courts can ensure accountability forserious violations of human rights, even in difficult humanitarian andpolitical contexts.[215]The High Commissioner’s statement is a welcomedevelopment. Overall, international experts with knowledge of how to handlecomplex criminal investigations, prosecutions, and trials can help build thecapacity of their national counterparts and promote procedures that provideguarantees of a fair trial. International staff can also help to bufferproceedings from political interference and foster judicial independence,particularly in sensitive cases such as Duvalier’s. In addition to theexpertise provided by the OHCHR, international donors can provide vital supportto the Haitian authorities—including through ongoing judicial reformefforts—in a number of ways. For instance, donors could consider fundinginternational experts to provide “behind the scenes” assistance toprosecutors, judges, and defense attorneys. It could also involve funding orseconding a temporary complement of international staff to work alongside Haitianstaff, which also would alleviate some of the human resource constraintsidentified above.d) A Safer Political Environment Can be CreatedThrough Political SupportTechnical assistance is important but it will be of littleconsequence unless Haitian authorities are committed to vigorously pursuing theevidence and trying Duvalier—and potentially others—fairly andeffectively. Unfortunately, the two presidential candidates in the March 20,2011 runoff have not yet demonstrated the requisite political will. (The electionresults from the March 20, 2011, were not available at this writing.) MirlandeManigat has indicated that the prosecution of Duvalier is “not [her]business.”[216]Michel Martelly has welcomed Duvalier’s return and indicated he would behappy to have Duvalier as an advisor.[217] Such positionsare inconsistent with Haiti’s international law obligations, as outlinedabove.Even under theadministration of President René Préval, which has supported theprosecution, the government has not yet done enough to create a safeenvironment for the investigation and prosecution of Duvalier. Several victimshave expressed concerns for their safety. A group of victims sent a publicletter to President Préval and several ministers calling on thegovernment to detain Duvalier during the pendency of the proceedings.[218] These victims protest that Duvalier is free totravel the country and give speeches, in the company of known macoutes,and to reactivate his network of “henchmen,” while victims faceintimidation and are afforded no protection.[219] The juge d’instruction issued an orderassigning Duvalier to his home, a form of house arrest, on March 24, 2011,while he was in a hospital.[220]Several people in direct contact with victims and witnessestold Human Rights Watch that, in fact, some victims and witnesses would notcome forward in the current environment, particularly given the likelihood thata new government less supportive of the case than the current administrationmay soon take power. To address these concerns, effective witness protectionand adequate security for prosecutors, court staff, and defense attorneys mustbe in place for procedures to be effective and fair.International donors have a role to play in supportingwitness protection and security programs as well as in supporting those inHaiti committed to the prosecution. Public statements by donors and high-levelforeign officials recognizing the importance of the case and notingHaiti’s obligations to pursue justice are essential. While UN HighCommissioner Pillay and UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon[221]have strongly backed the need to prosecute Duvalier-era crimes, other keyinternational actors have not made the same demonstration of support. P.J.Crowley, then spokesperson for the United States Department of State, statedthat what happens to Duvalier is “a matter for the Government of Haitiand the people of Haiti.”[222]This is of course is true, but Haiti also has international legal obligationsand will require strong international support to discharge those obligationsand to help foster a domestic climate that favors prosecution. The safety andsecurity of witnesses, victims, and judicial officers could be enhanced if theinternational community demonstrated its commitment to the case and admonishedany intimidation or threats designed to prevent the prosecution fromcontinuing.VII. ConclusionJustice means that the truth should be known, and that allthat happened did not happen in vain… I don’t want [money], to becompensated from his looted treasury.[223]—Michèle Montas, complainant in the case against Duvalier,Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 16, 2011The prosecution of Duvalier comes at one of the mostdifficult periods in Haiti’s already difficult history. In just over ayear’s time, Haiti has faced innumerable challenges, with the destructioncaused by the earthquake of January 12, 2010, a subsequent slow recovery,Hurricane Tomas, a cholera epidemic, and contested first-round presidentialelections. Despite the obstacles, we believe the prosecution of Duvalier shouldbe a priority, providing an opportunity for Haiti to break with the impunity ofthe past.[T]he return ofJean-Claude Duvalier has brought the country’s turbulent history ofState-sponsored violence to the fore. It is of vital importance that theHaitian authorities pursue all legal and judicial avenues in this matter. Theprosecution of those responsible for crimes against their own people willdeliver a clear message to the people of Haiti that there can be no impunity.[224]—BanKi Moon, UN Secretary General, Report to Security Council, March 24, 2011A Haitian proverb statesthat “a constitution is made of paper, but bayonets are made withsteel.”[225] This has been the legacy of most governments ofHaiti, not only of Jean-Claude Duvalier’s. Though it was one of the firstcolonies to win independence, Haiti’s path towards establishing the ruleof law has been tortuous. Throughout Haitian history, repressive rulers andtheir henchmen have bled the country and its citizens dry.[226] The law has been used to reinforce thedomination of a tiny elite over the great mass of poor peasants and workers andhas almost never functioned to punish even the worst massacres.[227] As a result, the Haitian poor justifiably havelittle faith in the Haitian state in general, and the legal system inparticular.[228]A fair and transparent prosecution of Duvalier inHaiti—in which victims are able to tell their stories and participate as“parties civiles”[229]for one of the first times in history,[230] and in whichDuvalier’s lawyers present a vigorous defense—could help to buildHaitians’ confidence in the justice system. It could also provide acivics lesson about a particularly dark period of Haitian history which mostHaitians today are too young to remember. In confronting its history head-on,Haiti has the opportunity to end the cycle of impunity that has left themajority of its citizens outside the protection of the law.Justice to me is just the same grappling of this experienceas I have always had . . . but there was an outcry from my gut that somethingwas wrong and it should be righted. 180 people died physically in front of mein eight, nine months. [T]wo or three persons a day, dying . . . Justice maynot right what I have seen, but maybe, I don’t know, it will be a beginning. . . To me, that’s. . . why I wanted to get this story out in the open.[231]—BobyDuval, complainant in the case against Duvalier, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March17, 2011AcknowledgmentsThis report was written byAmanda M.

In Blaskic, the accused had led his subordinates tounderstand that certain types of illegal conduct were acceptable and would notresult in punishment. Both Mucic and Blaskic tolerated indiscipline among theirsubordinates, causing them to believe that acts in disregard of the dictates ofhumanitarian law would go unpunished. It follows that command responsibilityfor failure to punish may be triggered by a broadly based pattern of conduct bya superior, which in effect encourages the commission of atrocities by his orher subordinates.” Ibid.[189] See Rome Statue of the InternationalCriminal Court (Rome Statute), adopted July 17, 1998, Doc.
