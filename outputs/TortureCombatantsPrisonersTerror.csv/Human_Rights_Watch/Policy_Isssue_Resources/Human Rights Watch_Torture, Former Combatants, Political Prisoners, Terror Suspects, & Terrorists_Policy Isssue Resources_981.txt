Executive Summary“When one judges oneself, one always tries to find ajustification. [Military officers] simply try to cover for one another.”—Widow of a young man killed by soldiers explaining herdoubts about the impartiality of the military justice systemSince taking office, President Felipe Calderón has reliedheavily on the armed forces to fight serious drug-related violence andorganized crime. The need to improve public security is clear. Mexico is facingpowerful drug cartels that are engaged in violent turf battles, an influx ofsophisticated weapons, a large number of kidnappings and executions in severalMexican states, and shocking forms of violence including beheadings. The competitionand fighting among powerful cartels, as well as shootouts between cartelmembers and law enforcement agents, have resulted in the deaths of thousands ofcivilians, police, and members of the military. The numbers of victims haverisen significantly since 2006, with the death toll reaching an estimated 6,000in 2008.Mexico has used its armed forces in counternarcotics andcounterinsurgency operations for decades. But the visibility of the armedforces in law enforcement operations has increased dramatically under theCalderón administration, which has portrayed the deployment of the armyas one of its key strategies to combat drug trafficking and increase publicsecurity. Thousands of members of the military have been incorporated into thefederal police force, and more than 40,000 military and police officers havebeen deployed throughout the country. In very violent cities, such as Ciudad Juárezand Tijuana, local governments have appointed high ranking military officers tohead the police forces. The Calderón administration has stated that theuse of the army is temporary, but has yet to present even a provisional planfor withdrawal of the troops.While engaging in law enforcement activities, Mexico’sarmed forces have committed serious human rights violations, including enforceddisappearances, killings, torture, rapes, and arbitrary detentions. The abuses detailedin this report include an enforced disappearance, the rape of indigenous womenduring counterinsurgency and counternarcotics operations in Southern Mexico,the torture and arbitrary detention of environmental activists duringcounternarcotics operations, and several cases of torture, rape, killings, andarbitrary detentions of dozens of people during public security operations in variousMexican states in 2007 and 2008. Many victims of the abuses documented in thisreport had no connection to the drug trade or insurgencies.Such horrific abuses directly undermine the goal of stoppingdrug-related violence and improving public security. The army is currentlydeployed in the areas of the country most torn by drug-related violence. Itwould be in the military’s best interest to act and be seen to act in amanner that is professional and respectful of civilians and human rights. Whensoldiers commit serious human rights crimes, they damage that image, alienatingcivilians and generating distrust and fear of the army in populations thatotherwise are best placed to assist law enforcement efforts. The abuses alsorun counter to one of the main purposes that the armed forces are charged withserving in public security operations: enforcing the law and protecting membersof the public—not harming them.An important reason such abuses continue is that they gounpunished. And they go unpunished in significant part because most cases endup being investigated and prosecuted by the military itself. By allowing themilitary to investigate itself through a system that lacks basic safeguards toensure independence and impartiality, Mexico is, in practice, allowing militaryofficers involved in law enforcement activities to commit egregious humanrights violations with impunity.The Mexican military court systemis failing miserably to provide justice in cases involving military abusesagainst civilians.  Although the opaque nature of the system and the factthat the authorities do not publicly report on the outcome of most casesobscures a complete picture of what happens in all cases, it is still evident thatvery few cases lead to convictions for the crimes committed.When, in January 2009, Human Rights Watch asked senior Ministryof Defense officials for examples of serious human rights violations prosecutedby the military resulting in the conviction and imprisonment of militarypersonnel, they said there were “many.” However, they were onlyable to recall one case from 1998.Despite repeated requests fromHuman Rights Watch, the Ministry of Defense has failed to provide a list ofsuch cases. It also has yet to provide a copy of the decision in the 1998 case.This report details 17 casesinvolving egregious crimes by soldiers against more than 70 victims, includingseveral cases from 2007 and 2008. None of the military investigations ofarmy abuses analyzed here has led to a criminal conviction of even a single soldier for human rights violations. A civilian investigation was conducted in one of thecases and led to the conviction of four soldiers. Something is terribly amissin how Mexico deals with allegations of serious human rights violations by themilitary.Because the military justicesystem is failing to hold perpetrators accountable, it is essential that suchcases be moved to the civilian justice system. This conclusion is fullysupported by international law. International law is clear that serious humanrights abuses must be subject to effective, independent investigation andprosecution, standards that the Mexican military justice system is manifestlynot meeting. Authoritative commentary on international law, including decisionsby the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, frowns upon military exercise ofjurisdiction in such cases because military justice systems are often opaqueand rife with potential conflicts of interest, the military sitting in judgmenton itself. The Mexican system is no exception: it is not structured to ensurefair outcomes and, as the record to date amply illustrates, it is not providingsuch outcomes.In Mexico, the secretary of defense wields both executiveand judicial power over the armed forces. Military judges have little jobsecurity and may reasonably fear that the secretary could remove them orotherwise sideline their careers for issuing decisions that he dislikes. Civilianreview of military court decisions is very limited. To make matters worse, thereis virtually no public scrutiny of, or access to information about, whatactually happens during military investigations, prosecutions, and trials,which can take years.These structural flaws are borne out in practice. TheMexican Ministry of Defense limits excessively and without reasonablejustification information the public’s access to basic information on thestatus of army abuse cases still pending before the military justice system,making it extremely difficult to know with certainty to what extent members ofthe armed forces are, in fact, being held accountable. In many cases, witnessesand victims are reluctant to testify or participate, afraid of the futureconsequences of speaking about military abuses in front of military officials.Available information indicates that the likelihood of obtaining justice insuch cases in the military justice system is very slim.As noted above, none of the military investigations of armyabuses analyzed in this report have led to a criminal conviction on humanrights charges. In older cases, military investigations led to impunity. And inmore recent cases of 2007 and 2008, the military criminal investigations haveeither been closed, or are being conducted in a manner that is likely to leadto impunity. Military prosecutors have, in several cases, closed investigationsfor lack of evidence in reliance on soldiers’ testimony, ignoringindependent, credible evidence that abuses in fact occurred. While the militaryhas at times provided monetary compensation to victims, such compensation doesnot make up for the lack of accountability in these cases.Despite these compelling facts,the military has persisted in invoking the Code of Military Justice anda strained constitutional interpretation to justifycontinuing to investigate the cases. Civilian prosecutors have routinelyaccepted the military’s jurisdiction grab with hardly a fight. This mustend or impunity will continue to prevail, ultimately undercutting the successof the effort to curb drug violence and protect public security.As detailed below, themilitary’s main argument as to why it has jurisdiction in cases involvingserious human rights violations against civilian victims is a constitutionalprovision that allows for military jurisdiction for “crimes andfaults against military discipline.” A key problem is that the Code ofMilitary Justice, purporting to interpret the Constitution, establishes a veryexpansive notion of such offenses that includes “faults under common orfederal law… when committed by military personnel in active service or inconnection with acts of service.” The military has interpreted this tomean that even egregious crimes such as rape and torture should be heard beforemilitary courts so long as the crimes are connected to a breach of militarydiscipline.But Mexico’s Constitutionand the Mexican Supreme Court do not prescribe this outcome. On the contrary,the text of the Constitution, its interpretation by constitutional law experts,and a recent Supreme Court decision favor civilian jurisdiction in such cases. Indeed,the military’s practice should have been brought to an end by a 2005Supreme Court ruling that is binding on all judicial authorities, includingmilitary ones. In its decision, the court limited the scope of the provision inthe Code of Military Justice by defining “service” as“performing the inherent activities of the position that [he or she] iscarrying out.” While the court did not explicitly state that all militaryabuses against civilians should be sent to civilian prosecutors and courts,serious abuses such as rape and torture clearly cannot be considered“inherent activities” of the military.The issue in Mexico is not theConstitution. It is the political will to ensure that cases of army abusesagainst civilians are heard where they belong: in civilian courts where therequisite of independence and public scrutiny help secure justice for thevictims.Note on MethodologyThis report’s findings are based onextensive interviews conducted during four research missions to Mexico City andCoahuila state in September 2008, November 2008, and January 2009, as well asprior and subsequent interviews by phone and email. Human Rights Watch carriedout interviews and meetings with Supreme Court justices, representatives fromlocal nongovernmental organizations, lawyers, journalists, scholars, stateattorney generals, and leading members of Mexican civil society. In January2009, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a series of meetings for HumanRights Watch with senior government officials, including the military’sattorney general, the head of the human rights office at the Ministry ofDefense, and representatives from the federal Attorney General’s Office, theMinistry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministryof the Interior.The findings are also based on officialresponses to over 40 formal information requests that Human Rights Watch sentto the Ministry of Defense and the National Human Rights Commission(Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, CNDH) through Mexico’sfederal access to information law and its implementing regulations. HumanRights Watch requested information on the status of military investigationsinto army abuses documented by the CNDH, as well as copies of importantdocuments that the CNDH cited as evidence in its reports documenting humanrights violations.The findings also draw upon the testimony of victimsand relatives of victims of military abuses. Given the difficulty of gainingaccess to victims and the fact that many are understandably reluctant totestify repeatedly to what were often traumatic experiences, Human Rights Watchhas also relied on official documentation that includes direct victimtestimony. For example, Human Rights Watch reviewed documentation submitted bynongovernmental organizations representing victims to the Inter-AmericanCommission on Human Rights (IACHR), listened to audio testimony given byvictims before the commission, and analyzed the testimony that victims gavebefore prosecutors, which the CNDH cited in its reports. For this report, HumanRights Watch directly interviewed four victims of army abuse or members oftheir families, working closely with their legal representatives, and also drewon interviews we conducted with several Atoyac de Álvarez residents fora previous Human Rights Watch report.Given the opaqueness of the military justicesystem, it is impossible to obtain complete information on the number, status,and outcomes of cases of human rights violations committed by the militaryagainst civilians that were investigated and tried by military courts. Thisreport focuses on 17 cases that were either presented before the Inter-AmericanCommission on Human Rights or documented by the CNDH and “accepted”by the Ministry of Defense. When the Ministry of Defense “accepted”the CNDH reports, it committed itself to, among other things, investigating theabuses and sanctioning those responsible.[1] We havedocumented the cases and the military investigations through the interviewsdescribed above, as well as through a variety of official documents that werepart of the IACHR or CNDH files, judicial rulings, sections of civilian andmilitary judicial files, and reports by the IACHR and the CNDH. Human RightsWatch also interviewed senior government officials, who described theirpolicies on the use of military jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute casesalleging military abuses against civilians. The officials, however, refused todiscuss any of the cases documented in this report.RecommendationsTo President CalderónWhen the Calderón administration adopted its“National Human Rights Program 2008-2012” in August 2008, it saidit would promote reforms to ensure that the military justice system compliedwith Mexico’s international human rights obligations. Two months earlier,the Congress had passed a comprehensive constitutional reform aimed atoverhauling Mexico’s dysfunctional criminal justice system, including themilitary justice system. The reform included basic due process guarantees inthe Constitution and required the adoption of an adversarial justice systemwith oral hearings.To implement the constitutional requirements, as well as tofollow through on his own stated commitment to strengthening the justice systemand the rule of law in Mexico, President Calderón, as head of the armedforces, should present a proposal to Congress to amend the military justicesystem. Specifically, the proposal should:Modify article 57 (II) of the Code of Military Justice sothat it explicitly states that at least cases of alleged serious humanrights violations committed by members of the armed forces againstcivilians, including enforced disappearances, torture, killings, arbitrarydetentions, and rapes, may not be prosecuted by the military justicesystem and must be immediately sent to civilian state or federalprosecutors.Instruct military authorities to cooperate fully withcivilian prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of militaryabuses against civilians.Ensure that military judges and magistrates have securityof tenure by establishing a specific period of time during which they willserve in their posts and clear reasons and mechanisms for their removal.Ensure that decisions adopted by military tribunals aresubject to comprehensive review by civilian authorities by, for example,appointing independent civilian judges to the Supreme Military Tribunal,or allowing for substantive review of military decisions by federalcourts.While the Congress discusses and adopts these legislativemeasures, President Calderón should instruct the Secretary of Defense toensure that:Military prosecutors and judges do not assert jurisdictionover cases alleging serious human rights abuses. They should, as well, bedirected to immediately send existing relevant case files to state andfederal prosecutors who should conduct the investigations. Once the casesare under civilian jurisdiction, military authorities should fullycooperate with the investigations.The Ministry of Defense increases the transparency ofproceedings within the military justice system, fully implementing thefederal law on transparency and Mexico’s obligations underinternational law. Among other things, it should provide basic informationto the public on the status of cases involving civilians; make it easy toobtain information on upcoming public hearings via the Ministry of Defensewebsite; and facilitate public access to military installations wheremilitary cases are heard.Finally, specifically in light of the crime of enforceddisappearances, President Calderón should present a proposal to theSenate to withdraw the reservation the government of Mexico made when ratifyingthe Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons in 2002, and to immediately recognize the competence of theCommittee on Enforced Disappearances established by the International Conventionfor the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which Mexicoratified in 2008.Although the Inter-American Convention states thatindividuals accused of carrying out enforced disappearances should be tried byordinary courts “to the exclusion of all other special jurisdictions,particularly military jurisdictions,” Mexico stated that its militaryjustice system may prosecute and investigate crimes if members of the militarycommit them while on duty. Although the validity of this reservation has notyet been studied by international bodies, Human Rights Watch believes itcontradicts the object and purpose of the treaty.In relation tothe International Convention for theProtection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Committee on EnforcedDisappearances wasestablished to receive and examine communications submitted by the victims ofenforced disappearances or their families or representatives, but Mexico failedto recognize its competence at the time of ratification.To the Federal Attorney GeneralThe federal Attorney General’s Office facilitatesmilitary jurisdiction by “automatically” sending all cases in whichan active-duty member of the military is accused of committing a crime tomilitary prosecutors.To promote accountability for army personnel who violate therights of civilians, the federal attorney general should instruct federalprosecutors to only send military prosecutors cases involving breaches ofmilitary discipline. All cases of alleged serious human rights abuses againstcivilians should be either investigated by federal prosecutors (if they involvethe alleged commission of a federal crime) or turned over to state authorities(if they involve the commission of a state crime).II. Mexico’s Laws on Military JusticeThe Mexican military routinely asserts jurisdiction overcases involving allegations of serious violations of the rights of civilians. But Mexico’s Constitution and the Mexican SupremeCourt do not require this outcome. On the contrary, the text of theConstitution, its interpretation by constitutional law experts, and a recentand binding Supreme Court decision militate in favor of civilian jurisdictionin such cases. And, in fact, civilian authorities have successfullyprosecuted military abuses, as attested to by the Castaños case,detailed in chapter V of this report. The military’s practice ofasserting jurisdiction in cases involving army abuses against civilians also disregardsthe recommendations of several international bodies that have specificallyaddressed the issue.The assertion of military jurisdiction in these cases isproblematic because of a built-in conflict of interest: the military is sittingin judgment on itself, and the Mexican military justice system is notstructured to address alleged violations of the rights of civilians independentlyand impartially. The secretary of defense wields both executive and judicialpower over the armed forces. Military judges have little job security and mayfear that the secretary will remove them or otherwise sideline their careersfor issuing decisions that he dislikes. Civilian review of military court decisionsis very limited. To make matters worse, there is virtually no public scrutinyof, or access to information about, what actually happens during militaryinvestigations, prosecutions, and trials, which can take years.Overview of the MilitaryJustice SystemThe military justice system consists of the MilitaryAttorney General’s Office (Procuraduría General de JusticiaMilitar, PGJM), the military’s Public Defense Office, and militaryjudicial bodies, which include judges, ordinary and extraordinarycourts-martial, and the Supreme Military Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Militar,STM).[2]The PGJM is charged with investigating all cases that enterthe military justice system. A military prosecutor may press charges (ejercitarla acción penal) against a member of the military or he may closethe investigation and send it to the archives if there is not enough evidenceto charge the accused with a crime—a decision that must be approved bythe military attorney general.[3]Throughout the investigation and judicial process, a military public defenderor a private lawyer, who can be a civilian, defends the accused.[4]First instance tribunals may consist of military judges or“ordinary courts-martial,” which are collegiate bodies thatdetermine if the accused is guilty but do not set the sentences.[5]Military judges carry out all procedural steps of the judicial investigation inevery case.[6]If a military prosecutor accuses a member of the military of a crime or offensethat is punishable with a sentence of two or more years in prison, the judgemust ask his superior to convene an ordinary court-martial.[7]Once the prosecutor has pressed charges, a military judgedoes a preliminary analysis of available evidence to decide whether thereshould be a judicial investigation.[8]If he thinks there is enough evidence, he must issue an arrest warrant (autode formal prisión).[9]The judge then conducts the investigation (instrucción)through written and oral proceedings. The written submissions are not public, butthe oral proceedings include hearings that are open to the public.[10]However, in practice, access to military installations where these hearingstake place is difficult.[11]Based on the evidence and arguments presented by the prosecutor and defender,the judge determines whether it is necessary to convene a court-martial. If hedeems it is not, the judge will directly issue the ruling deciding the case.[12]If an ordinary court-martial is convened, its members carryout a series of public and oral hearings during which they can review all the evidencethat was previously submitted to the judge, and can accept new evidence if thepresident considers it necessary.[13]In the open hearings, the court-martial members cross-examine witnesses, andthe accused may directly address the court-martial.[14]The court-martial then deliberates in closed sessions to decide on theculpability of the accused.[15]Based on the court-martial’s decision, the judge will issue the rulingand determine the appropriate sentence.[16]Military judges’ decisions may be appealed to theSupreme Military Tribunal, which can review legal as well as factual issues.[17]That tribunal’s decisions are subject only to very limited review bycivilian courts, as described below.Applicability ofMilitary JurisdictionThe Mexican Constitution allows for military jurisdictiononly for “crimes and faults against military discipline.”[18]This provision makes sense and is consistent with international law, but onlyso long as breaches of military discipline are not defined so broadly that theyinclude serious criminal acts against civilians, including rape, enforceddisappearances, and related abuses. A key problem in Mexico is that the Code ofMilitary Justice, purporting to interpret the Constitution, establishes a veryexpansive notion of such offenses that includes “faults under common orfederal law… when committed by military personnel in active service or inconnection with acts of service.”[19]Based on this broad definition, the Mexican military hasexpanded the scope of cases it asserts a right to investigate and prosecute toinclude serious human rights violations committed by the military againstcivilians.[20]According to the head of the PGJM, the military investigates all crimes—includingserious human rights violations—that are somehow connected to a breach ofmilitary discipline, because they must maintain discipline within the ArmedForces.[21]The federal Attorney General’s Office (Procuraduría General de laRepública, PGR) effectively supports this view by“automatically” sending all cases in which an active-duty member ofthe military is accused of committing a crime to the PGJM.[22] Asthis report documents in chapters III and IV, the military has been allowed to initiatecriminal investigations into even egregious abuses.This practice, however, should have been brought to an endby a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that is binding on all judicial authorities,including military ones. Over 30 years ago, the Mexican Supreme Court issuedseveral contradictory and non-binding decisions that did not clearly definewhen a crime could be committed during or in connection with “activeservice” and thus erratically sent cases involving civilian victimsalternatively to military and civilian courts.[23] But in 2005 thecourt clearly limited the scope of the provision by defining“service” as “performing the inherent activities of theposition that [he or she] is carrying out.”[24]The court did not explicitly state that all military abuses against civiliansshould be sent to civilian prosecutors and courts but serious abuses such asrape and torture clearly cannot be considered “inherent activities”of the military.Mexican constitutional law experts also note that theConstitution clearly provides that civilian prosecutors should investigatecases when a civilian commits, or is a victim of, a crime.[25]The Constitution states that “under no cause and for no circumstance maymilitary courts extend their jurisdiction over persons which are not members ofthe Armed Forces” and that “when a crime or a fault involves acivilian, the case shall be brought before the competent civilauthority.”[26]While the language seems clear (and prominent constitutional law expertsbelieve it to be so), the Supreme Court has equivocated. It has ruled that civilianswho commit crimes must always be tried by civilian courts, but has not said thesame when it comes to cases in which the civilian is the victim rather than theperpetrator.[27]Indeed, the court has occasionally issued non-binding rulings allowing militarycourts to investigate cases involving civilian victims.[28]Perhaps the best evidence that it is possible for militaryabuses in Mexico to be investigated by civilians is that, in fact, it hashappened. This report examines in detail in chapter V a case in which soldierswho raped and sexually abused women in Castaños, state of Coahuila, wereprosecuted by civilian prosecutors and sentenced by a civilian judge. TheCoahuila state attorney general takes the view that federal prosecutors shouldinvestigate a case if a military official commits a crime against a civilianwhile on duty, given that soldiers are federal officials; state prosecutors shoulddo so if a military official commits a crime against a civilian while off duty;and military prosecutors should only investigate cases in which soldiers whoare on duty commit offenses strictly against military discipline.[29]Moreover, the government of Mexico has agreed to send specific cases ofmilitary abuses that had originally been investigated by military prosecutorsto the civilian justice system after the victims and their families went to theInter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).[30]Even if the Code of Military Justice suffered from someambiguity regarding when military jurisdiction is applicable, it should beinterpreted in light of Mexico’s international obligations, which areclear.[31]The Mexican Supreme Court has ruled twice that Mexico is bound by itsinternational obligations and that the provisions of treaties ratified byMexico take precedence over federal and state statutory law (but not overprovisions of the Constitution).[32]Therefore, if in doubt, courts must adopt an interpretation of federaland state laws that is compatible with international law, particularly in casesinvolving human rights.[33]Structural DeficienciesThe military justice system lacks the necessary safeguardsto ensure judicial independence and impartiality, reliable investigations, andaccountability.The Military as Judgein Its Own CauseThe military justice system is not part of thecountry’s judiciary. The secretary of defense, a military officerappointed by the president, has both executive and judicial powers within thearmed forces.The secretary of defense is charged with directing the armedforces.[34]Soldiers must abide by due obedience rules.[35]And because of the military’s command structure, the secretary of defenseis ultimately responsible for soldiers’ official actions.[36]The secretary of defense also directs the military justicesystem.[37]The secretary appoints all military prosecutors, public defenders, and judges,who must all be active members of the military and are hierarchically below(and must respond to) the secretary.[38]The secretary also has the power to order a military prosecutor to closean investigation, and to issue military pardons when military courts convictsoldiers.[39]Lack of Security of TenureMilitary judges and magistrates do not have security oftenure. The Code of Military Justice does not set a time frame for theappointment of military judges and magistrates. According to senior officialsof the Ministry of Defense (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional, SEDENA),judges and magistrates are, in practice, subject to a “high level ofrotation” and usually remain in their posts between one and three years.[40]Judges and magistrates are subject to the sameadministrative personnel policies as the rest of the members of the ArmedForces, and may thus be removed “in accordance with the current needs of SEDENA.”[41]And while in the federal and state civilian justice systems there areindependent bodies, called judiciary councils (consejos de la judicatura),in charge of sanctioning judges, the Supreme Military Tribunal is in charge ofthis task within the military justice system.[42]Under these circumstances, military judges work knowing theymight be removed if they issue decisions or rulings that the secretary of defensedislikes.Limited Civilian OversightThere is very limited civilian judicial review of decisionsadopted by military prosecutors and courts. The military officer accused ofcommitting a crime may request such a review, but is unlikely to do so in casesof grave human rights abuses, and will certainly not challenge decisions favoringhim or her.[43]Victims of abuse—who have the clearest interest in moving cases ofmilitary abuses against civilians from military to civilian courts—havenot been able to challenge the use of military jurisdiction.[44]So when military prosecutors and judges assert jurisdiction over a case ofmilitary abuses against civilians, in practice there is very little thatcivilian officials can do to move the case to civilian courts until the case isdismissed or a verdict rendered.Senior SEDENA officials told Human Rights Watch that federaljudges usually confirm decisions by military courts, arguing that this is aclear indication that the military justice system works.[45]But this argument fails to take into account that federal courts are usuallynot reviewing the question of whether there should be military jurisdiction inthe first place.In theory, a civilian judge could ask the Supreme Court todecide which court has jurisdiction if both civilian and military courts claimjurisdiction over a case. But this has not happened in recent years becausecivilian prosecutors routinely send cases to their military counterparts,preventing civilian judges—who do not even know about thecases—from claiming jurisdiction over cases in which serious human rightsviolations are alleged.[46]The only remedy available to civilian victims is to requestan injunction (amparo). But this remedy is only available in limited circumstances,such as when a military prosecutor closes an investigation or decides not topress charges against a member of the military accused of a human rightsviolation. And there is nothing the victim can do until the prosecutor formallycloses the case, which can take years. In any case, federal courts cannotoverturn a military prosecutor’s decision; they can only ask militaryprosecutors to do their job right. The only way to ensure that militaryprosecutors comply with such a ruling is to file another request for aninjunction, which will once again be sent back to military courts.Finally, there is no real way to challenge, in civiliancourt, a Supreme Military Tribunal’s ruling acquitting the accused.Neither military prosecutors nor victims may appeal such a decision.[47]Only the accused could file an injunction in such a case and he or she would behighly unlikely to challenge a decision benefiting him or her.[48]Limited TransparencyThe general public has no way of accessing substantiveinformation about military investigations and prosecutions of military abusesagainst civilians until there is a final ruling, and there is no way of knowinghow long that will take.The military justice system is mostly closed to the public.[49]Only those who are formally parties to the process—prosecutors, publicdefenders, the accused, and the victim if he or she decides to cooperate withprosecutors—have access to complete information on the case.[50]In theory, the public can obtain detailed information on the status of casesthrough victims or their legal representatives, but most victims deeplydistrust the military justice system and in practice participate minimally, ifat all, in the military proceedings.[51]Indeed, as several cases documented in this report show, many victims andmembers of civil society organizations distrust military courts and do not wantto “legitimize” the process by being part of it.Military judges and ordinary courts-martial in theory hold“public” hearings, but there is no easily accessible informationavailable on upcoming hearings, which makes it all but impossible for ordinarycitizens and journalists to attend. There is no information available on SEDENA’swebsite as to which cases will be heard in public hearings, nor the dates andtimes when they will take place. Human Rights Watch called six SEDENAoffices—including the PGJM, the Office to Assist Citizens (Oficina deAtención Ciudadana), military courts, and SEDENA’s human rightsoffice—and no one provided specific dates and times of upcoming publichearings.[52]SEDENA also applies confidentiality norms in a blanketfashion, denying access to meaningful information on the status ofinvestigations into military abuses against civilians, even in the most wellknown cases. Human Rights Watch submitted 13 information requests to SEDENA onthe status of several investigations into egregious human rights abusesdocumented by the CNDH in recent years. In its responses, SEDENA only providedinformation on whether an investigation was still open or had been closed. SEDENAprovided no further information on the status of open investigations, arguingthey are confidential, and refusing to provide even the most basic information,such as the types of crimes being investigated.[53]In some cases, SEDENA even failed to provide information it had provided to theCNDH, and which the CNDH had published in its annual report.[54](The CNDH itself also refused to grant Human Rights Watch access to informationit has on the status of military investigations into these cases.)[55]Finally, it is impossible to know when the public will learnmore about the military investigations and prosecutions.[56]According to senior officials, SEDENA considers information on any caseconfidential until there is a final judicial ruling that is not subject to anyappeal, and they have an “absolute prohibition” on providinginformation until then.[57]III. A Pattern of ImpunityMilitary investigations into grave human rights abusescommitted by the military over the past few decades have routinely failed tohold perpetrators accountable, contributing to a culture of impunity. When, inJanuary 2009, Human Rights Watch asked senior SEDENA officials for examples ofcases of serious human rights violations committed by the military that weredealt with by military courts and led to convictions, they said there were“many.” However, they were only able to recall one case from 1998.[58]Despite repeated requests from Human Rights Watch, SEDENA has failed to providea list of such cases. It also has yet to provide a copy of the decision in the1998 case.The Mexican military is responsible for the vastmajority of the abuses committed during the country’s “dirtywar” in the 1960’s and 1970’s, including the torture andenforced disappearance of hundreds of civilians. But no member of themilitary has ever been convicted for these crimes.An important reason for this impunity is that the Mexicanmilitary stonewalled civilian investigators and interfered with prosecutions bypressing charges in military courts against members of the military for thesame crimes that federal prosecutors were handling. If the defendants wereacquitted in military courts, they became immune from prosecution in civiliancourts. Also, while SEDENA has declassified important documents from the“dirty war” era, it has done virtually nothing to help civilianinvestigators understand or locate evidence within the released files, orobtain information that appears to be absent from those files.[59]A similar pattern is evident in military investigations intoabuses committed during other major public security operations in the Mexicancountryside. These include the use of the army to respond to the 1994 armeduprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (Ejército Zapatistade Liberación Nacional, EZLN), a guerrilla organization in the southernstate of Chiapas, and government attempts to combat drug trafficking inGuerrero since the 1980’s. Military prosecutors investigating abusescommitted in these two states—including torture, arbitrary detentions,and rapes—relied heavily on soldiers’ version of events, and failedto seriously consider the victims’ testimonies and other independentsources documenting the abuses. The result, not surprisingly, was closedinvestigations and impunity.Enforced Disappearances during the “Dirty War”The “Disappearance” of RosendoRadillaRosendo Radilla Pacheco was detained bysoldiers on August 25, 1974, when he was traveling by bus with his 11-year-oldson in the state of Guerrero. When the bus stopped for a second time at amilitary checkpoint, soldiers ordered passengers to get off. After threemembers of the military checked the bus and the passengers’ belongings,they allowed everyone to return to their seats but told Rosendo that he wasbeing detained for “composing corridos,” a type of popularMexican music. Rosendo asked his son, who was allowed to go, to inform hisfamily that he had been detained by the military.Rosendo was last seen in militaryinstallations in Atoyac de Álvarez, Guerrero, in 1974. According towitnesses, soldiers blindfolded him and tied his hands, tortured and threatenedhim, telling him he would be “thrown to the water as food for thefish.”[60]Rosendo’s whereabouts remain unknown.The Military Investigation“It has been [over] 30 years without an answer…I need to know what happened to him,” said Tita Radilla Martínez,one of Rosendo’s daughters, with tears in her eyes. Her experience withthe Mexican military justice system has led her to conclude that “so longas these cases remain with military prosecutors, nothing will be done ... Weshould not have to go to a military court.”[61]The first official recognition that Rosendo had been“disappeared” came in 2001, more than 10 years after the Radillafamily had asked the CNDH to look into the case.[62]The CNDH examined 532 cases and issued a non-binding report in 2001concluding that there was sufficient evidence to establish that at least 275individuals—including Rosendo Radilla—had been arrested, tortured,and “disappeared” by state forces during the “dirtywar.” (It did not rule out the possibility that the other 257 individualshad also been “disappeared” during that time.)[63]Civilian prosecutors only began investigatingRosendo’s case when, following the CNDH’s intervention, in November2001 the government created a federal special prosecutor’s office toinvestigate and prosecute the “dirty war” crimes Follow.[64]Until the commission’s report, there had been no serious criminalinvestigations, despite the Radilla family’s repeated requests thatauthorities initiate them.[65]But the civilian investigations ended up in military courts.The special prosecutor filed “abduction” charges against GeneralFrancisco Quirós Hermosillo in August 2005. A civilian judge issued anarrest warrant, but then turned the case over to the military justice system, arguingQuirós Hermosillo was a military official and was accused of an act thathe committed while on duty. The military judge that received the case acceptedjurisdiction, but the military prosecutor who had to investigate it actuallysought to return it to civilian authorities, arguing that he did not havejurisdiction to evaluate the retired general for these acts.[66]But in October 2005 a federal civilian court ruled once again that the case didin fact belong within the military justice system.[67]The Radilla family unsuccessfully challenged the use of themilitary justice system to investigate and prosecute Rosendo’s enforceddisappearance. In September 2005 they presented an injunction (amparo)requesting that the case not be sent to military courts. The first instance judgerejected the request, arguing that Mexican law only gives victims of abusestanding to present injunctions in very specific circumstances, which do notinclude challenging the decision regarding which justice system should hear acase. A higher court confirmed this ruling in November 2005.[68]Quirós Hermosillo was never tried nor convicted. InJanuary 2006 a military judge determined there was no evidence to startinvestigating his criminal responsibility and set him free. Militaryprosecutors appealed the decision, which was upheld by the Supreme MilitaryTribunal. After the military prosecutors presented new evidence, anothermilitary judge issued a second arrest warrant, and in October 2006Quirós Hermosillo was formally accused of illegally detaining RosendoRadilla. However, the military judge closed the case in November 2006, afterQuirós Hermosillo had died.[69]This case is now pending before the Inter-American Court onHuman Rights (IACHR), which has the power to issue a binding decision regardingMexico’s international responsibility for the detention, torture, andsubsequent “disappearance” of Rosendo Radilla, as well as on thestate’s failure to hold those responsible accountable.[70]Undermining AccountabilityWhen the military insists on carrying out theseinvestigations, it effectively blocks any possibility that members of themilitary will be held accountable in civilian courts. If the military trialsend in acquittals, a subsequent prosecution of these officers by civilians isbarred under the principle of non bis in idem—the principle, knownas “double jeopardy” in Anglo-American jurisdictions, according towhich a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime.The likelihood of such an outcome is increased by the factthat very few of the relatives and surviving victims in Guerrero have beenwilling to testify before the PGJM. As a result, the PGJM is unable to obtain evidencethat may be necessary to secure convictions. The main reason for thevictims’ refusal appears to be fear of the military. Several Atoyacresidents told Human Rights Watch that they disregarded the request fortestimony from the PGJM because they were scared of the army,andthe one person Human Rights Watch spoke with who had provided testimonyconfirmed that most victims’ relatives she knew were too scared to do so.[71]Another woman who refused to testify explained that she could not believe thatthe military had any intention of conducting a serious investigation.“They ignored us back then,” she said, “why would it be differentnow?”[72]One man who reported having been tortured by soldiers, who also forcibly“disappeared” his son, said he would never go to the PGJM since itwas the military that had harmed him.[73]Another woman asked rhetorically, “How am I going to go to the PGJM whenI’m denouncing an army general?”[74]The Conflict in ChiapasThe Detention, Torture, and Rape of the GonzálezPérez SistersOn June 4, 1994, approximately 10 members of the militaryarbitrarily detained Ana, Beatriz, and Celia Pérez—who were then respectively20, 18, and 16 years old—and their mother, Delia Pérez deGonzález, in the municipality of Altamirano, Chiapas, as they werereturning from a nearby town where they sold their agricultural products.The three sisters, who were members of the Tzeltal ethnicgroup and spoke little Spanish, were taken to a windowless one-room house wheresoldiers beat and repeatedly raped them while attempting to force them toconfess they were members of the EZLN. A thorough medical examination showedthat the three women had been sexually abused and had suffered severe physicaland psychological harm as a consequence of these acts.[75]Their mother was forced to stay outside the house during the rapes.According to the oldest sister’s testimony, a soldierthrew the three women onto the floor and hit them until “they could nolonger defend themselves.” While one soldier held her and took her clothesand underwear off, another man raped her. She testified she “felt greatpain and felt as though [she] was dying and then passed out.” When sheregained consciousness, another soldier was on top of her. She tried to screambut the man pushed a handkerchief into her mouth and covered her eyes with a pieceof cloth. She recalled that throughout the two hours in that room, the soldierswere laughing and saying that the Zapatistas were “delicious.”[76]After the rapes, a military official threatened the four women saying that ifthey reported the incident they would be detained again, imprisoned, and maybekilled.[77]As a consequence of the humiliation and the stigmatizationcreated by these abuses, the González Pérez sisters and theirmother left their community.[78]The Military InvestigationThree days after the González Pérez sistersreported the rapes to the PGR, the PGR turned the investigation over tomilitary prosecutors, arguing it did not have jurisdiction to investigate it.[79]A year later, the military closed the case. The militarycase file includes statements provided by several individuals who attest to the“good conduct” of the soldiers and deny that the rapes occurred,but it completely ignores the gynecological exam submitted by theGonzález Pérez sisters to the PGR, as well as their testimonies.In fact, military prosecutors ordered another gynecological exam. When thesisters refused, the prosecutors closed the case in September 1995, arguingthat there was “lack of interest of the victims and theirrepresentatives.”[80]The González Pérez sisters took their case tothe IACHR, which ruled in April 2001 that the Mexican government wasresponsible for the arbitrary detention, torture, and rape of the sisters, aswell as for not conducting a thorough, prompt, and impartial investigation intowhat had happened.[81]The Mexican government initially tried to justify using themilitary justice system to investigate and prosecute this case. Governmentrepresentatives argued before the IACHR that this case had to beinvestigated by military prosecutors because the armed forces were carrying outpublic security activities in Chiapas and the soldiers were “on duty andnever left the location, since the place where the alleged victims were takenfor interrogation was within the radius of the area assigned for theperformance of the activities.”[82]In 2008 government officials and the ComisiónMexicana de Defensa y Promoción de los Derechos Humanos (CMDPDH),representing the victims, signed an agreement before the IACHR in which theCMDPDH agreed to work with military prosecutors to help them carry out threenecessary steps within the military investigation, with the purpose of sendingthe case to civilian prosecutors.[83]Fourteen years after the rapes, the case appears finally to be heading to acivilian court.Militarization of GuerreroIllegal Detention and Torture of Environmentalist PeasantsOn May 2, 1999, following a raid in Pizotla—a smallvillage 10 hours by foot from the nearest road in the mountains of westernGuerrero—soldiers detained Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, twopeasant leaders involved in environmental activism.[84]The military held them illegally for two days. On themorning of May 4 a helicopter took them to a military base in the town ofCiudad Altamirano, Guerrero, where they were kept for at least the rest of thatday, before being turned over to the civilian authorities.[85]When the soldiers finally presented them before civilianauthorities, Montiel and Cabrera confessed to having been caught “infraganti” with the illegal drugs and weapons that the soldiers claimed tohave found on them. However, they later recanted these confessions before ajudge, claiming they had been subjected to torture both in Pizotla and at thearmy base. The torture, they alleged, included beatings, electrical shocks,pulling their testicles, and shining a light into their eyes. The CNDHeventually found that the soldiers had planted at least some of the evidencethat the two men later confessed to possessing, and concluded that both Montieland Cabrera had been subjected to arbitrary detention and torture.[86]A judge issued a guilty verdict against both men on drugsand weapons charges in August 2000.[87]Despite highly questionable assertions in the testimony provided by thesoldiers who detained the two men, their version of events was granted the“presumption of good faith.”[88] Despite seriouscontradictions in the self-incriminating statements by the defendants, these initialconfessions were given greater weight than their later statements. And despiteevidence of torture documented by Physicians for Human Rights-Denmark, thejudge chose to rely on initial findings by the prosecutor’s office, whichreported finding no signs of recent physical abuse.[89]The Military InvestigationA federal prosecutor initiated an investigation into thetorture allegations in October 1999, but the following month ceded jurisdictionto the PGJM.[90]Montiel and Cabrera attempted—unsuccessfully—tocooperate with the PGJM. They repeatedly requested authorization to cooperatewith prosecutors in the investigation (as “coadyuvantes”),and offered evidence for military authorities to take into consideration.[91]The two men also asked military prosecutors to send the case to civiliancourts, arguing that the military courts lacked independence and impartialityto resolve the case.[92]According to the Centro Prodh, the nongovernmental organization that legallyrepresented Montiel and Cabrera, they were never allowed to cooperate with thePGJM. In fact, they only learned what had happened with the militaryinvestigation in 2007 through information obtained from the IACHR.[93]The PGJM closed the investigation and ordered that it bearchived in November 2001, with a decision that arbitrarilydismissedthe claims that Montiel and Cabrera’s rights were violated. The PGJM saidit did not find evidence that Montiel and Cabrera had been arbitrarilydetained, held illegally for two days, or tortured.[94]The decision sticks to the military’s version of the events and uses itto rebut the CNDH’s findings and dismiss the validity of the Physiciansfor Human Rights report. It completely fails to consider evidence offered byMontiel and Cabrera.The case is now pending before the IACHR, which issued areport on the merits in November 2008.[95]At thiswriting, the report is not yet public.The Rape of Inés Fernandez Ortega[96]On March 22, 2002, 11 soldiers arrived at the house ofInés Fernandez Ortega, an indigenous woman of the Tlapanec Me'paa peoplein Guerrero, who was at home with her four children aged three, five, seven,and nine. Three soldiers arbitrarily entered the house, asking Inés:“Where is your husband? From where did he steal the meat that you have onyour patio?” The soldiers pointed their guns at her chest, grabbed herhands and threw her violently onto the floor, shouting at her, “Are yougoing to talk or not?” The children fled the house in fear and went totheir grandfather to ask for help.Inés could not answer the soldiers’ questionsbecause she does not speak Spanish, which infuriated the men. One of thesoldiers grabbed her hands with his right hand, and with the other hand heremoved Inés’ underwear, pulled down his pants, and raped her forapproximately ten minutes. When he finished, the soldiers left, stealing themeat Inés and her family had on their patio.After the rape, Inés has been stigmatized by members of hercommunity. Inés continues to be afraid of the military and constantlyfears that she or her children could suffer similar abuses again.The Military InvestigationTwo days after the rape, Inés lodged a formalcomplaint before the civilian state prosecutor’s office in Ayutla de losLibres, Guerrero, asking state prosecutors to investigate the rape and illegalentry into her home. The state prosecutor determined he was not competent toinvestigate the rape, the robbery, or the illegal entry into Inés’home because “the individuals who are probably responsible [for thecrimes] belong to the Mexican army.” In May 2002 he sent the case tomilitary prosecutors.[97]Inés unsuccessfully challenged the use of militaryjurisdiction in her case before Mexican courts.[98]After military prosecutors rejected her request to refrain from asserting theirjurisdiction over the case, she presented an injunction (amparo) beforefederal courts.[99]Both a first instance judge and a higher court rejected her appeal,arguing that Inés did not have standing to challenge a decisionregarding which government authority was competent to investigate a case.[100]The PGJM formally closed the case in March 2006, arguingthat there was no evidence that members of the military were responsible forthe rape or the illegal entry into Inés’s home. The prosecutorsbased their decision on the testimony of the accused soldiers, who denied theaccusations, and on testimonies of other individuals who were not present atthe time that the events took place.[101]Theyalso argued that Inés had not provided enough information to identifythe person responsible for the crime and that she had not participated in themilitary investigation, even though the CNDH documented how militaryprosecutors had not adequately notified Inés of the proceedings.[102]According to government officials, the militaryinvestigation had been limited to analyzing if soldiers had committed a breachof military discipline, and civilians are investigating the rape.[103]However, the military decision in fact goes far beyond reviewing whether therewas a breach of military discipline by, for example, analyzing whether thegynecological exam performed on Inés after the rape constitutes validevidence. In any case, the civilian investigation is not likely to yieldjustice for Inés because, even though Inés had reported that shehad been raped by soldiers, the PGJM sent the military file to civilianauthorities so they could investigate “the possible participation ofcivilians in the case in which Inés Fernandez Ortega was a victim ofabuse.”[104]The case is now pending before the IACHR, which issued areport on the merits in November 2008.[105]At this writing, the report is not yet public.[106]The Rape of Valentina Rosendo Cantú[107]On February 16, 2002, Valentina Rosendo Cantú, a16-year-old member of the Tlapanec indigenous community in Caxitepec, Guerrero,was washing clothes in a stream near her house when eight soldiers showed up.When she was unable to respond to the soldiers’questions, two of them raped her. The soldiers surrounded Valentina and two ofthem walked up to her, asking angrily, “Where are the hooded [people]?”When she said she did not know, one soldier threatened to shoot her and,pointing his gun at her, asked her if she was from Barranca Bejuco, a nearbycommunity. She was not. Another soldier showed her a picture and a list ofnames, asking her if she recognized anyone. She did not. A soldier hitValentina in the stomach; she fell and passed out for a few minutes. When sheregained consciousness, she sat down and one of the soldiers pulled her hairand violently asked her: “How come you don’t know, aren’t youfrom Barranca Bejuco?” Valentina explained she had only recently moved toBarranca Bejuco, after getting married. Two soldiers scratched her face, tookher skirt and underwear off, and raped her, one after the other, while theother six men witnessed the rapes.It took Valentina months to obtain adequate medical care. Afterthe rape she got up and, practically naked, ran home. She went to a localhospital, where doctors refused to treat her saying they did not want“trouble” with the military and did not have adequate equipment.She then traveled eight hours by foot to another hospital in Ayutla, where adoctor determined she had been beaten in her abdomen, but did not provide anymedicine or order the necessary lab exams. Only several months later, after herlegal representatives intervened, did Valentina obtain adequate gynecologicalhealthcare, including an operation.After the rape, Valentina’s husband left her and shelost the support of her community as a result of the stigmatization shesuffered.The Military InvestigationOn March 8, 2002, Valentina presented a formal complaintbefore state prosecutors in Ayutla de los Libres, Guerrero, stating she hadbeen raped by soldiers. Two months later, the state prosecutor’s officesent the case to military prosecutors, arguing they had jurisdiction toinvestigate the case because the accused were members of the military.[108](The military had already initiated an investigation into the case, based on anews article accusing soldiers of raping and beating an indigenous woman).[109]Valentina repeatedly—and unsuccessfully—challengedthe use of military jurisdiction to investigate her case. She first refused tocooperate with the military investigation, and requested that the militaryprosecutor refrain from asserting jurisdiction in her case.[110]Subsequently, she filed several requests for injunctions (amparos)before federal courts challenging the assertion of military jurisdiction in hercase, but civilian courts rejected her claims, arguing the accused weresoldiers who were “on duty” when they committed the alleged crime,which made it a case of an alleged breach of military discipline.[111]Valentina learned in October 2007—after a publichearing before the IACHR—that the military had closed its investigation morethan three years earlier, in March 2004. The military argued that it had foundno evidence to prove that Valentina had been raped by soldiers.[112]The Mexican government says it is conducting a thoroughinvestigation at the state level. At the international hearing—and morethan five years after Valentina asked state authorities to investigate therape—the Mexican government agreed to request that military prosecutorssubmit the information in their files to state prosecutors so they couldinvestigate the rape.[113]The military sent the files in January 2008, and the state prosecutors’office reopened the investigation in May.[114] Mexicanofficials say that the PGR then attempted to carry out procedural steps onbehalf of the state prosecutors’ office but Valentina repeatedly refusedto cooperate with federal officials. They say that it is Valentina’sfailure to cooperate that is impeding justice in this case.[115]However, Tlachinollan, the nongovernmental organizationrepresenting Valentina before the IACHR, told Human Rights Watch that theybelieve the 2008 investigation by the state prosecutors’ office, whichwas reopened after years, is focused on the possible responsibility ofcivilians in Valentina’s rape and is not seriously investigating thesoldiers. At a minimum, this case demonstrates how the military’sexercise of jurisdiction, and the lengthy delays that have accompanied it, haveundermined the victim’s trust, and thus, prospects for justice.[116]The case is now pending before the IACHR.[117]IV. An Ongoing PracticeTo this day the military justice system continues to assertjurisdiction over the most egregious abuses against civilians—includingkillings, torture, arbitrary detentions, and rapes—committed by themilitary during counternarcotics and law enforcement operations. SEDENA limitsexcessively and without reasonable justification basic information on thestatus of its investigations, so it is extremely difficult to know withcertainty to what extent members of the armed forces are being heldaccountable. However, a review of available information about themilitary’s handling of well known cases from 2007 and 2008 suggests thatthe likelihood of obtaining justice is slim.First, none of the military investigations analyzed in thischapter, which involve 11 cases and dozens of victims, have led to a criminalconviction. The military has closed its investigation in four cases, saying ithad found no evidence to charge soldiers with any crime or that the statute oflimitations had expired. The other seven cases are still pending (most of themare still officially under investigation), in some instances almost two yearsafter the abuses took place.Second, the limited information available about the investigations shows thatthey have suffered from serious problems. Military prosecutors have, forexample, relied on evidence planted by soldiers to support SEDENA’sallegations that the military had detained individuals “infraganti,” which would justify the detention. They have also failed tosubject soldiers who were allegedly drunk to a timely alcohol test. Often,military prosecutors appear to have completely ignored evidence documenting theabuses, instead giving undue weight to the accounts of the military. In atleast one case, the military has investigated soldiers for only minor crimes(e.g. “abuse of power”), failing to pursue an investigation for themore serious crimes that were allegedly committed. In another, victims have notparticipated in the investigations, mostly because the military failed to workwith them.While the military has at times provided monetarycompensation to victims, such compensation does not make up for the lack ofaccountability in these cases.RecentAbuses during Counternarcotics and Public Security OperationsThis section analyzes how the military justicesystem has addressed dozens of military abuses—including killings,arbitrary detentions, torture, and rapes—committed during law enforcementand counternarcotics operations in 2007 and 2008. The principal sources for allof these cases are CNDH reports documenting the abuses, as well as evidenceincluded in such reports. All of these cases received widespread attention inthe media when the reports were made public. SEDENA “accepted” allof the CNDH’s reports, thereby committing itself to, among other things,investigate the abuses and sanction those responsible.[118]Illegal Detention and Abuse of 36 Civilians and Rape of FourMinorsAfter unknown individuals attacked members ofthe military, killing five soldiers on May 1, 2007, hundreds of soldiers wentto the municipalities of Nocupétaro, Carácuaro, and Huetamo inMichoacán state seeking the aggressors. Theycommitted dozens of abuses, including arbitrary detentions, illegal detentionsat a military base, torture, beatings, rapes, and illegal entries into homes.[119]During the two days that followed the ambush, soldiersarbitrarily detained 36 people, including five minors, holding most of them atthe military base in the 21st Military Zone for up to 84 hours.[120]They repeatedly beat the detainees, tied their hands with tape or rope, and insome cases covered their heads with a plastic bag or cloth. One of thedetainees had burns on his skin, and another reported that the soldiers hadpushed his head into a container with water to force him to provideinformation. The soldiers kept the majority of the detainees incommunicado, andheld four of them with their faces and eyes covered the whole time.Four of the people detained for over 20 hourswere girls under 18 years old at the time, who testified before federalprosecutors that soldiers repeatedly beat, sexually abused, and raped them withthe purpose of obtaining information about their supposed links with armedgroups and drug traffickers. The girls revealed how soldiers forced them onto ahelicopter, where they then threatened and sexually abused the girls. One girlsaid that the soldiers told them, “fucking human rights don’texist, we will throw you in the sea and you will be food for the sharks.”Another stated that they forced her to keep her skirt up and her underweardown, while soldiers said, “fucking bitch, (…) this is what youlike.” A soldier took a prayer card of the Virgin Mary that a third girlhad with her, made a small ball out of it, and introduced it into her anus.According to the fourth girl, soldiers told her, “Not even the Virginwill get you out of this.” When they arrived at the militaryinstallations, they were forced to inhale a substance that made them sleepy,and awoke feeling terrible aches in their bodies, particularly in their lowerabdomen. Some of the girls noticed they were spitting foam from their nose andmouth, and that a liquid was flowing out of their vagina, producing an itchysensation.[121]The soldiers also illegally entered over 30homes, threatening the people inside with their guns, and stealing cash, cellphones, and jewelry.The Military InvestigationAlmost two years after the events, the PGJM is stillinvestigating soldiers’ responsibility for the abuses. The federalprosecutor, who began investigating the case, determined on May 30, 2007, thathe lacked jurisdiction and sent it to military prosecutors.[122]Initially, the PGJM only initiated a criminal investigationinto the possible rape of the four girls. Despite the evidentiary value that avictim’s testimony has in any criminal investigation into a rape, SEDENAtold the CNDH that it had completed “90 percent” of theinvestigation, before having even obtained the testimony of two of the girls.[123]In spite of their initial testimony describing the rapes and medical evidenceanalyzed by the CNDH supporting their claims, the PGJM said that two of thegirls had told military prosecutors that they were not willing to press chargessince they had not been raped, beaten, or mistreated by members of themilitary.[124]As of January 2009, the PGJM is still investigating the case.[125]It is unclear whether the PGJM is investigating the rest ofthe abuses, and no substantive information on the status of such investigationsis available. SEDENA told Human Rights Watch in January 2009 that it had notinitiated any other criminal investigation as a consequence of the abusesdocumented by the CNDH.[126]However, it had previously informed the CNDH that it was investigating the“beatings and alleged acts of torture.”[127]Regarding the status of that investigation, SEDENA only stated that the PGJMhad conducted “40 percent” of the investigation.[128]IllegalDetention of Eight Civilians and Torture of Four, including a ChildOn May 7, 2007, soldiers from the 51st InfantryBattalion belonging to the Mixed Operations Base “Tierra Caliente”detained six men, a woman, and a child after a shootout between the militaryand alleged drug traffickers—which lasted over an hour and left severalmembers of the military injured and four civilians dead—in themunicipality of Apatzingán in Michoacán state. None of thedetainees were involved in the shootout.[129]When the shooting broke out, some of the detainedindividuals were in the area purchasing agricultural products, while otherswere inside their homes. The soldiers detained the eight people soon after theviolence ended, and took them to military installations in the 43rd MilitaryZone, where the soldiers tortured four of them, including the child. Thetorture included beatings, kicks, placing their heads in black bags, which madeit difficult for them to breathe, and forcing them to lie on the floorblindfolded, while soldiers asked “who they worked for.”Although Mexican law states that individuals must beimmediately presented before a judge, soldiers held the detainees for 15 hoursin military installations, before taking them in front of a federal prosecutor.The soldiers argued that the detainees had been caught “infraganti” and should be investigated for their responsibility in theshootout. But three days later, federal prosecutors determined there was noevidence to charge the eight people with any crime and set them free.Other soldiers illegally entered nine homes in the area, allegedlydamaging property and stealing cell phones, cameras, jewelry, and cash.The Military InvestigationSEDENA has closed one criminal and one administrativeinvestigation, and sent them both to its archives. On May 15, 2007, the federalprosecutor who investigated the detainees’ alleged responsibility in theshootout informed the PGJM that it should investigate the soldiers who hadexceeded their functions.[130]In less than a month, the PGJM closed the only criminal investigation it had beguninto a possible breach of military discipline in this case, arguing that therewas no evidence that “the acts investigated by the militaryprosecutors’ office … constitute a criminal act.”[131]From available evidence, it is unclear whether the military investigated thedetention, the torture, or both. SEDENA also sent the administrativeinvestigation it had begun to the archives, stating that the administrativebodies had no jurisdiction to investigate probable human rights abuses.[132]Killingof Two Women and Three Children and Wounding of Three OthersOn June 1, 2007, soldiers who were stationed on the side ofa road in the municipality of Sinaloa de Leyva in Sinaloa state, and werereportedly drunk and using drugs, opened fire on a truck transporting threeadults and five children, killing a woman and a 3-year-old girl.[133]SEDENA argues that the vehicle failed to stop at thesoldiers’ request, and the soldiers fired their guns to defend themselves,only after they heard shots (fogonazos). According to their account,once the shooting stopped, they found two individuals dead and six injured, andthey provided first aid to the injured passengers. SEDENA says they found asack of marijuana next to the truck.However, evidence indicates that the soldiers opened firewithout justification. For example, state prosecutors found that there were nosigns warning drivers that the military had a checkpoint in the area and werethus required to slow down. There is no evidence to support SEDENA’sclaim that the civilian passengers had fired guns at the soldiers, but there isextensive forensic evidence demonstrating that the deaths and injuries werecaused by guns fired by members of the military. Also, a soldier reported tomilitary prosecutors that the soldiers had received orders to plant evidence(marijuana) next to the truck, which would enable them to argue they had caughtthe passengers “in fraganti” during the commission of a crime, andthat their actions were therefore justified.Soldiers allegedly delayed the injured passengers’access to urgent medical care, which led to three more deaths.[134]When family members of the passengers arrived at the scene, soldiers told themthat a helicopter was on its way to transport the injured people to a hospital.After waiting three hours for the helicopter, the family members decided todrive the injured passengers to the nearest hospital. During the trip they weredetained by soldiers at three different check points, for a total time ofnearly two hours, though they had informed the soldiers each time that theywere transporting individuals in need of urgent medical care. At one location,a military vehicle escorted them at a very slow speed, further delaying theirarrival at the hospital. Three passengers finally died in the cars. Red Crossambulances then transported the three surviving, injured passengers to thenearest hospital.In their testimonies before federal prosecutors and theCNDH, the family members who were transporting the injured passengers statedthat soldiers detained them and forced them to stay all night—reportedly insidetheir cars with the dead bodies—on the premises of a military base. Thefollowing morning the soldiers told them that the bodies would be taken to anearby hospital.The Military InvestigationThe PGJM is still investigating the abuses, but availableinformation indicates that the military has conducted flawed criminalinvestigations. The military has paid monetary compensation to the victims.On June 1, 2007, federal prosecutors initiated a criminalinvestigation, and two days later, responding to a request from militaryprosecutors, sent the case to the PGJM.[135] The militaryprosecutors pressed charges against some of the soldiers who fired at thetruck, and on June 10, 2007, a military judge issued arrest warrants for 19soldiers.[136]As of January 2009, the case was still pending before military courts.[137]An investigation into all the other abuses is also still pending.[138]There are indications that the military’sinvestigation has serious flaws. Despite evidence that seven soldiers hadtested positive for marijuana use, and one had tested positive for methamphetaminesand cocaine, military prosecutors failed to request that all the soldiersinvolved be subjected to appropriate and timely testing.[139]Military prosecutors failed to thoroughly investigate the allegations that thesoldiers had planted evidence. Finally, PGJM had initially only investigatedthe soldiers who fired at the truck (and one captain for other crimes relatedto the CNDH findings), and apparently only included the other abuses in theinvestigation after the CNDH made its report public.[140]Soon after military judges issued the arrest warrants, SEDENAagreed to pay monetary compensation to the victims and their families.[141]SEDENA refused to provide Human Rights Watch with a copy of the agreement,arguing that since it had not yet entirely complied with the CNDH’srecommendations, the document containing the agreement was confidential.[142]However, it did give the CNDH the names of the victims receiving compensation,as well as the amount of Mexican pesos given to each person, and the CNDHpublished this information in its 2008 annual report.[143]IllegalDetention and Torture of José Fausto Galvez MunguíaOn June 7, 2007, José Fausto Galvez Munguíaand two others were close to the U.S. border in the state of Sonora, waitingfor a man who had promised to help them cross the border and travel to Phoenix,Arizona, when two Mexican Army vehicles, with personnel from the 40th MilitaryZone, arrived.[144]The soldiers pointed their guns at the men, asking them whotheir boss was and “where the drugs” were. They tortured Galvez forfour hours. When Galvez explained why they were there, a soldier kicked him inthe ribs and another pulled his hair and ordered him to get into a militaryvehicle. The soldiers beat Galvez, threw him out of the car, and dragged him toa location where they forced him to drink an alcoholic beverage, which causedhim to vomit. The soldiers inserted pieces of wood under his nails and movedthem around to inflict pain, and then pulled out one of his nails.The soldiers left Galvez lying unconscious in thecountryside. When he awoke, Galvez managed to walk to a road, where a passerbypicked him up and drove him to the nearest hospital.The Military InvestigationGalvez asked a federal prosecutor in Sonora to investigatehis allegations of military abuse on June 15, 2007. The federal prosecutor sentthe case to the state attorney general’s office, which had alreadystarted an investigation. But on February 5, 2008, the state prosecutordetermined the case should be investigated by military prosecutors. As ofJanuary 2009, the PGJM was still investigating the case.[145] SEDENApaid monetary compensation to the victim before concluding the militarycriminal investigation.[146]IllegalDetention and Torture of Oscar Cornejo TelloOn June 13, 2007, Oscar Cornejo Tello was watching TV withtwo other people in a home in the municipality of Morelia in Michoacánstate, when 15 members of the military illegally entered the house shouting,“Open the door, son of a bitch!”[147]When Cornejo opened the door to let the soldiers in, theythrew him on the floor and tortured him. The soldiers asked him if his nicknamewas “Chino Güenses,” and when he said it was not, theycovered his head with a piece of cloth and then used it to choke him. Thesoldiers gave electric shocks to his testicles and kicked and beat him forapproximately 30 minutes.The soldiers took Cornejo in handcuffs to the 21st MilitaryZone, where he was detained for seven hours, until he was finally presentedbefore a federal prosecutor. (SEDENA reported at the time that soldiers haddetained Cornejo “in fraganti,” when he was driving a car, in whichsoldiers found weapons and drugs, contradicting the evidence gathered by theCNDH.)The Military InvestigationA federal prosecutor pressed charges against Cornejo forpossessing drugs and illegal firearms, but he also determined that militaryprosecutors should investigate the possible responsibility of members of themilitary in the abuse of Cornejo.[148]The PGJM started investigating the possible “abuse of power” bymembers of the military on July 9, 2007, and as of January 2009, the caseremains at the investigation stage.[149]SEDENA has already paid monetary compensation to the victim.[150]Tortureand Death of Fausto Ernesto Murillo FloresOn August 3, 2007, soldiers detained three men in themunicipality of Naco in Sonora state, but only presented two of them before thestate prosecutor, accusing them of possessing illegal firearms. The body of thethird man, Fausto Ernesto Murillo Flores, was found the following day on theside of a road in Sonora, showing signs of torture.[151]According to a witness’s account, after detainingMurillo the soldiers beat him repeatedly, while asking him where they couldfind weapons and drugs. The witness heard that Murillo appeared to be drowningand heard the soldiers threatening to put alcohol in his nose. The witness alsosaw soldiers place a plastic bag over Murillo’s head. Soldiers continuedto beat Murillo until, stated the witness, “suddenly he was still; he nolonger complained or said anything.”SEDENA blamed Murillo’s health conditions for his“natural” death after being detained, contradicting thewitness’s account, the autopsy, the CNDH’s findings, and SEDENA’sown initial account, according to which it had only detained the two other men(and not Murillo).[152]In its second report on the case, SEDENA said that Murillo had died when he wasdetained, and that the cause of death was a heart attack, which was theconsequence of “addiction to cocaine and tobacco, obesity, and being sedentary.”However, according to documentation—including a medical forensicevaluation—analyzed by the CNDH, Murillo’s death was likely theconsequence of asphyxia.SEDENA’s second version, that Murillo had in fact beendetained and died as a consequence of his health troubles, does not explain whyhis body was found on the side of a road.The Military InvestigationThe day Murillo’s body was found, a state prosecutorin Sonora began investigating the homicide, but a few months later sent thecase to military prosecutors, who were already investigating the case.[153]The PGJM pressed charges against six soldiers, accusing them of torturingMurillo.[154]But the military judge determined the statute of limitations on investigatingthe soldier’s probable responsibility for the crime of“desertion” had expired, and closed the case.[155] SEDENAinformed the CNDH that it initiated another criminal investigation, but thereis no information available on which crimes are being investigated or what thecurrent status of the investigation is.[156] SEDENA paid thevictim’s family monetary compensation.[157]IllegalDetention and Torture of Jesús Picazo GómezOn the night of August 21, 2007, five members of the 37thInfantry Battalion of Zamora in Michoacán state—who belonged tothe “Mixed Operations Base Uruapan”—detained JesúsPicazo Gómez when he was leaving his aunt’s house to buy food.[158]For over 24 hours the soldiers illegally held Picazoincommunicado in military installations. Soldiers beat and kicked him,blindfolded him, and took him to a military base in Uruapan. There the soldiersplaced a cloth bag on his head, threw him onto the floor, tied his arms andfeet, and poured water on his face while they hit his abdomen and asked him fornames of people in his community who produced and sold drugs. Picazo spent thenight naked at the base.The following morning, Picazo was taken to another militarybase where soldiers continued beating and throwing him against a wall, whilethey showed him pictures and asked if he recognized anyone. When he said he didnot, the soldiers repeatedly forced his head into a container full of water,reportedly for periods of up to three minutes, and applied electric shocks tohis stomach.It was not until 11 p.m. on the day after his detention thatsoldiers took Picazo before a federal prosecutor, arguing they had detained him“in fraganti” for possessing drugs and illegal firearms.[159]The prosecutor filed charges against Picazo, but the judge who heard the caseordered his immediate release, stating his detention had been illegal.The Military InvestigationAfter Picazo’s release, a federal prosecutor initiateda criminal investigation into the possible responsibility of two members of themilitary for the abuses.[160]Three days later he sent the case to a military prosecutor, who beganinvestigating the case on September 20, 2007.[161]Despite the existence of medical exams by civilian authorities documenting thetorture, eleven months later the PGJM closed the investigation, arguing thatmilitary prosecutors did not find evidence that soldiers had committed a crime.[162]However, the military paid Picazo Gómez monetary compensation.[163]IllegalDetention and Torture of Antonio PaniaguaAt 5 a.m. on October 7, 2007, soldiers from the 37thInfantry Battalion of the Mexican Army—belonging to the Mixed OperationsBase in Zamora, Michoacan—illegally entered Antonio PaniaguaEsquivel’s home while he and his family were sleeping.[164]After entering Paniagua’s home, soldiers took him outof bed, threw him on the floor and started kicking and beating him. Thesoldiers took Paniagua to the second floor of the house, where they forced himto lie down facing upwards, blindfolded him, stepped on his hands, placed atowel with water on top of his face making it difficult for him to breath, andapplied electric shocks to his genitals.The soldiers then kept Paniagua at a military base for twohours. Finally, they presented Paniagua before a federal prosecutor, arguing thathe had been detained “in fraganti” in possession of illegal firearms.[165]By then, eight hours had passed since the illegal entry into his home.The Military InvestigationA federal prosecutor pressed charges against Paniagua onOctober 12, 2007, accusing him of possessing weapons that may only be used bythe armed forces. The same prosecutor determined that it was likely thatmembers of the military had committed irregularities when they detainedPaniagua, so he forwarded a copy of the investigation to the PGJM.[166]Military prosecutors closed the investigation on July 23, 2008, finding thatthere was no evidence that soldiers had committed any crime.[167]The military did, however, pay Paniagua monetary compensation.[168]Deathof Victor Alfonso de la Paz Ortega and Wounding of Juan Carlos PeñalozaGarcíaOn the evening of January 11, 2008, a soldier from the 12thInfantry Battalion of the Mexican Army opened fire on a car in the municipalityof Huetamo in the state of Michoacán, killing 17-year-old VíctorAlfonso de la Paz Ortega.[169]When the driver, Juan Carlos Peñaloza García, 19, stopped the carafter his friend had been killed, the soldiers forced him out of the vehicle,hit him with a gun, and kept him on the floor, facing downwards.In its official response to the CNDH, SEDENA argued that asoldier shouted at the driver, asking him to stop, after the driver had failedto obey signs on the street warning drivers to reduce their speed.[170]According to SEDENA, when the driver did not stop, the soldiers were forced toreact, since the man in the passenger’s seat had a gun and they fearedfor their lives. A soldier fired a first shot in the air and when he saw thatthe car did not stop, fired two shots at the vehicle’s wheels.According to the information that the CNDH gathered whendocumenting the case, however, the soldier’s reaction constituted anunjustified, excessive use of force. There were no clear “warningsigns” on the street that demonstrated the military was present in thatarea of town or that would have indicated to the driver that he needed to slowdown. Authorities found a plastic gun inside the car, but since the incidentoccurred at night and the car had tinted windows, it would have been nearlyimpossible for soldiers to see if the passenger had a gun. There was noforensic evidence of shots fired from inside the vehicle. There was evidenceshowing that the soldier had fired only three shots and there had been no firstwarning shot in the air.The Military InvestigationSEDENA is only investigating some of the documented abuses,but has already decided to provide victims and their families monetarycompensation.[171]The Michoacán State Prosecutor’s Office immediately initiated acriminal investigation into de la Paz’s death and sent it to the PGR,which, in turn, sent it to military prosecutors at the PGJM’s request.[172]The PGJM initiated a criminal investigation into the probable responsibility ofone soldier in the homicide of de la Paz, but failed to investigate thoseresponsible for beating Peñaloza García.[173]As of January 2009, the PGJM was still investigating the homicide.[174]Killingof Sergio Meza Varela and Wounding of José Antonio BarbosaRamírezOn February 16, 2008, at least three soldiers, who wanted tostop a car in Reynosa in the state of Tamaulipas, opened fire on the vehiclewithout justification, killing Sergio Meza Varela and injuring JoséAntonio Barbosa Ramírez.[175]Although SEDENA argued that the soldiers had opened fire to“repeal an aggression,” there does not appear to be any evidencethat the men in the car had attacked the soldiers. When the state prosecutorand his staff arrived at the scene they searched the car in which Meza andBarbosa were traveling and did not find any firearms. Also, a general submitteda written document to the state prosecutor stating he had not “detectedany firearm [held by] the civilians.” Finally, a test for gun residuefound no evidence that either man had fired a gun immediately before theevents, and there was no proof that anyone had shot from inside the car.The Military InvestigationThe Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office initiated aninvestigation into the probable responsibility of the soldiers, but four dayslater it determined it did not have jurisdiction to analyze the case and sentit to military prosecutors. As of January 2009, the PGJM was still investigatingthe case.[176]SEDENA has already paid victims and their families monetary compensation.[177]Killing of Four Civilians andAbuse and Arbitrary Detention of Four OthersAt approximately 9:00 p.m. on March 26, 2008, six peoplewere returning from a party near the community of Santiago de Caballeros, inthe Badiraguato municipality of the state of Sinaloa, when a military truckbegan to pursue their car. Suddenly, the military truck pulled alongside thevehicle and nearly crashed into it.[178]More than a dozen soldiers opened fire from close range without any apparentjustification, killing four civilians. Two soldiers were also killed,reportedly by friendly fire.[179]The driver was shot first and lost control of the car, whilethe passengers began to yell that they were unarmed and pleaded with thesoldiers to stop shooting.[180]But the shooting continued andfour of thepassengers—including one man who was intellectually disabled —werekilled.[181]Two passengers survived, but one was wounded. The soldiers also accidentallykilled two of their own men who had been traveling inside the military truck.The military found no weapons in the car, but they detainedand beat the surviving passengers. Wilfredo Medina, who suffered a gunshotwound and several other injuries in the attack, said soldiers forced him andthe other survivor to lie face down in the dirt with their hands on the back oftheir necks. When Medina moved his hand slightly to stop blood from runningfrom a gash on his head, a soldier kicked him repeatedly in the face.[182]The soldiers also detained two other civilians who were traveling in a separatevehicle. The military forced them to lie face down in the dirt for seven hours,without any explanation as to why they were being held, and then released themwithout charge.[183]At first, the military characterized the incident as a clash,rather than a one-sided attack. The day after the incident, three rankingmilitary officers who were involved claimed that the civilian vehicle had fled,despite the military’s order to stop.  They also stated that thesoldiers had opened fire only after they heard guns being fired by the victims,saying the military then “proceeded to repel the aggression.”[184]Early press reports cited official sources who described the incident as“an ambush that targeted the military as they carried out a sweep tosearch for drug plantations in the area” and described the victims as“four suspected assassins of the drug trade.”[185]However, evidence that emerged from official investigationsand witness accounts contradicts the military’s initial account. The twopassengers who survived testified that no one in the vehicle had been carryingweapons or fired on the military vehicle.[186] This finding wasconfirmed by several government experts, including federal and stateinvestigators, who found that all the bullets had been fired by the militaryand the civilians had been unarmed.[187]This evidence led the state prosecutor, who was reviewing the charges againstthe civilians for homicide and injuring soldiers, to conclude that theiraccount of the events was more credible than the military’s, and thesurvivors were released.[188]The Military InvestigationAs described in detail below, after persuading the federalprosecutor to turn over jurisdiction, the PGJM neglected to gather key piecesof evidence, raising doubts about its thoroughness and objectivity during theinvestigation. It also repeatedly failed to act in the interest ofvictims’ families, excluding them from the inquiry, denying them informationabout the case, and rushing them through a flawed compensation process.Within hours of the incident, both the PGR and the PGJM had launchedpreliminary investigations into the events. Three days later, responding to arequest from military authorities, the federal prosecutor refused to assertjurisdiction to continue investigating the case.[189]He effectively handed control over to the military courts, in spite of the factthat, by that time, preliminary investigations had proved the militaryofficers’ initial accounts of the incident to have been fabricated.[190]The military prosecutor charged five officers with“violence against persons causing homicide and injuries,” butconducted the investigation in a manner that raises questions about themilitary justice system’s neutrality and thoroughness.[191] Themilitary did not administer drug or alcohol tests to the soldiers, despitereports from residents in the village near the incident that the soldiersinvolved had been drinking since early in the afternoon and that they smelledof marijuana.[192]Such tests were, however, administered to the civilian passengers.[193]No military officers were charged with abusing or arbitrarily detainingcivilians. Finally, military prosecutors charged only five of the 13 soldiers whohad fired their weapons during the incident.[194]In the course of the investigation, military prosecutorsmade little or no effort to contact the victims’ families or collecttheir testimony. Initially, the family members were given no information aboutthe incident or the preliminary investigations carried out by military or civilauthorities.[195]Without information from the authorities, victims’ families were left topiece together what had happened from press accounts, which in the firstseveral days wrongly portrayed their relatives as “hired assassins”or drug runners. “I felt totally powerless,” said one widow,“because on top of the injustice they had committed, they were dirtying[the victims’] names.”[196]At no time before charging the five officers did the military prosecutorcollect testimony from the two survivors or from the families of the victims.[197]This suggests that the military relied solely on the investigation of the crimescene and testimony from the soldiers—some of whom had fabricated earlieraccounts—as its sources.One of the victims’ relatives said she believed thesoldiers would receive more lenient judgments in military courts. “Whenone judges oneself, one always tries to find a justification,” she said.[198]She also explained her doubts about the impartiality of the military justicesystem by stating that, “[military officers] simply try to cover for oneanother.”Family members of the victims sought, on two separateoccasions, to obtain an injunction (amparo) in civilian courts challengingthe use of military courts to try the killings.[199]In both cases a military judge submitted arguments defending militaryjurisdiction, arguing that any time a soldier commits a violation in the act ofservice, it “invariably” affects military discipline, which is“the spinal cord of the armed forces.”[200]The two injunctions were rejected by lower courts, which ruled that the victimsdid not have legal standing to present such a request.[201]The victims’ relatives have since appealed the decisions to higher courts,and have requested that Mexico’s Supreme Court hear the cases, due to the“interest” and “transcendence” of their cases.[202]The Supreme Court decided in March 2009 to look into one of the cases, but haveyet to rule on the merits at this writing.[203]As civilian courts were reviewing the requests forinjunctions, the military offered the families of the victims killed a one-timeopportunity to obtain compensation. But the process left the civilians littletime or leeway to review the content of the proposal, challenge its conditions,or consult with their lawyers. When the families arrived at a meeting scheduledthe same day by state officials, members of the military’s human rightsoffice presented them with a pre-written compensation agreement and told them thatthey had until the end of the afternoon to accept or reject it. Thevictims’ families’ lawyer is based in Mexico City and could notattend the meeting because there was no advance notice.[204]The military representatives made clear that the offer would be their onlychance to receive payment. “We felt pressured into deciding thatday,” one of the family members who attended the meeting told HumanRights Watch.[205]One of the terms of the agreement was that, by signing, family members wouldrelinquish the right to pursue any legal action seeking further compensationfor their losses. In the end, due in large part to financial burdens left bythe loss of a wage earner and bearing funeral costs, the families decided tosign the agreements.[206]Not only did the agreement fail to reflect thefamilies’ concerns, but it was not even executed as the victims hadunderstood it would be. SEDENA informed Human Rights Watch that it hadnegotiated with the state government of Sinaloa for “the granting ofscholarships for the minors who were left in a state of orphanhood.”[207]However, according to the victims’ families and their lawyer, only onescholarship has been awarded per family—forcing survivors to choose from amongseveral children, which one will be able to go to school.[208]V. The Exception that Provesthe Rule: The Castaños CaseOn July 11, 2006, municipal police officers detained a soldierwho, dressed as a civilian, was causing trouble in a nightclub in the“red light district” of Castaños in the state of Coahuila.After, five other men who identified themselves as members of the 14th MotorizedRegiment of the Mexican Army (14Regimiento Motorizado delEjército Mexicano) requested their colleague’s release. When thepolicemen released him, the soldiers threatened to come back.  When theydid, half an hour later, they insulted, threatened, beat, and sexually abused14 women who worked in the nightclubs, and beat seven police officers.Although far from perfect, the Castaños case standsout as an example of how criminal investigations into military abuses againstcivilians should be carried out in Mexico. The military investigated breachesof military discipline, sanctioning soldiers who abandoned their duties. Andcivilians investigated the crimes against civilians that soldiers carried out,obtaining convictions and substantial sentences against three members of themilitary who are now being held in state prisons (a fourth one was released onbail).The military may have had no choice but to cede jurisdictionin this case because there was no possible argument that the abuses took placeduring the soldiers’ discharge of their duties. The incident occurred afew days after the controversial presidential elections of 2006, when thesoldiers were supposed to be safeguarding electoral ballots held at a FederalElectoral Institute (Instituto Federal Electoral, IFE) office in Monclova,Coahuila. Instead, they were several kilometers away, drunk and abusing womenin a nightclub in Castaños.While the reasons for civilian jurisdiction in this casewere unusually clear, the same approach is warranted wherever militarypersonnel are alleged to have committed serious human rights violations. Actsof torture, rape, and unjustified use of lethal force against civilians shouldno more be considered part of soldiers’ discharge of their duties thanshould egregious criminal behavior in a nightclub.A distinctive factor in the Castaños case is that allactors involved believed that these cases did not belong in military courts,and acted accordingly. The state prosecutor investigated the case, the lawyersrepresenting the victims collaborated with the prosecutor’s office, and acivilian judge convicted four soldiers. The state human rights commission andcivil society, including the Bishop of Saltillo, immediately called forcivilian investigations into these cases. The local media covered thejurisdictional dispute extensively, publishing several articles favoringcivilian prosecutions. And military authorities collaborated with civilianones.The events in Castaños offer several importantlessons. The first is that Mexican law, as it stands, does allow civilianauthorities to prosecute military abuses against civilians. A second lesson isthat consensus between government officials and nongovernmental actors on howthese cases should be dealt with, together with extensive coverage in themedia, helps push forward civilian investigations and convictions. Finally,this case shows that victims of abuses can play a critical role by speaking upagainst military abuses. It is extremely unlikely that victims would be willingto challenge their aggressors in this way before military prosecutors andcourts, because of the widely shared perception—confirmed by decades ofexperience—that they will not find justice in military courts.TheAbusesAt around 2 a.m., a group of 10 to 20 members of themilitary wearing uniforms arrived in official vehicles at “ElPérsico Dancing” and “Las Playas Cabaret,” twonightclubs in the “red light district” of Castaños. Duringthe following three hours, soldiers subjected 14 women who worked at the clubsand seven policemen who were providing security in the area to intimidation andabuse.The CNDH has documented that the soldiers verbally abusedthe women, forced them to dance at gunpoint, and forced them into rooms. Thesoldiers threatened the women, forced them to undress, raped them (onoccasions, repeatedly), sexually abused them, made them masturbate in front ofthe soldiers, and/or forced them to perform oral sex. One woman became pregnantas a consequence of the rape, and another, who was already pregnant, had anabortion after that night.[209]TheInvestigationsMilitary and civilian authorities carried out two parallel,distinct investigations into these cases. The military investigated breaches ofmilitary duties, sanctioning soldiers who abandoned their duties, and civiliansinvestigated the crimes against civilians.The day after the soldiers committed the abuses, the PGJMinitiated an investigation into nine soldiers’ responsibility for“abandoning their service.”[210] The militaryjudge issued arrest warrants for all of them, but three soldiers were neversubject to this criminal investigation because two deserted and one wasdismissed from the armed forces.[211]One soldier was sentenced to two years in prison for “abandoningservice.”[212]The civilian state attorney general, for his part,investigated the military abuses against civilians. Although militaryprosecutors initiated a criminal investigation into the abuses, they cededjurisdiction to civilian authorities, arguing they had documented“conduct by members of the military outside their acts of service…which, since they are not typically military crimes, must be investigated bystate authorities.”[213]By mid-August 2006, the state attorney general had asked a judge to issuearrest warrants for 12 different soldiers.[214] A week later, thecivilian judge authorized the indictment of eight of the 12 (four are at large).[215]In October 2007, a civilian judge convicted four soldiers ofthe rape or sexual abuse of nine women and injuries to six police officers.[216]The judge held that four other soldiers were not guilty, and did not rule onthe criminal responsibility of the four men that the victims held were guilty butwho were not indicted and are at large.[217] Three of theconvicted soldiers are being held in the state prison, and one of them (who wasconvicted for beating five police officers, but not for rape or sexual abuse)was released on bail.[218]Though the civilian investigation and the judicial rulingare important steps toward promoting accountability for military abuses, theCNDH noted several shortcomings in the prosecutor’s and judge’swork. It noted that the state prosecutor’s office did not make use of allavailable witnesses and did not press charges for torture.  Further, theCNDH emphasized that the judge’s ruling did not address all of the abusesthe commission had documented.[219]The state prosecutor appealed the judicial ruling,requesting a higher court to reverse the non-guilty verdicts and impose higher penaltieson those found guilty.[220]At this writing, the appeal is pending before the state’s highest court.[221]TheConsensusThe principal reason for the civilian prosecution of membersof the military is probably the fact that there was total consensus inCoahuila—including among government authorities and civilsociety—that the military should not prosecute these cases.The Coahuila state attorney general told Human Rights Watchthat he did not ask the military for permission to analyze the case because hehas the authority, as well as the obligation, to investigate it. According tothe state prosecutor, civilian authorities must analyze any case in which amilitary official commits a crime against a civilian. If the crime or offensewas committed off duty against a civilian, the case should be investigated bystate authorities; and if the crime is committed while the soldier is on duty,the case should be investigated by federal authorities, given that soldiers arefederal employees.[222]The first instance criminal judge who convicted the soldiers upheld the viewthat this case belonged in civilian courts.[223]Other actors also played important roles in pushing forcivilian investigations. The Bishop of Saltillo openly spoke up about the caseimmediately after it took place.[224]The victims’ lawyers collaborated with state prosecutors to build thecases.[225]The Coahuila State Human Rights Commission asked the CNDH, and all other statehuman rights commissions, to support its request to the Mexican president andthe secretary of defense to present the soldiers involved in the abuses beforestate judicial authorities.[226]And the local media covered the case extensively, giving visibility to severalarguments favoring civilian prosecutions.[227]Even the military collaborated with civilian authorities bydetermining it had no jurisdiction to investigate the sexual abuses and thebeatings. According to both the state attorney general and the civilian judge,military authorities have fully collaborated with them throughout theinvestigation.[228]TheLessons of CastañosThe horrific crimes committed by soldiers in Castañosoffer several important lessons regarding the use of military jurisdiction toinvestigate and prosecute military abuses against civilians in Mexico.The first lesson is that the Mexican Constitution does notrequire the military to prosecute these types of crimes committed by soldiersagainst civilians.Secondly, a consensus between government officials andnongovernmental actors on how these cases should be dealt with helps pushforward civilian investigations and prosecutions, which are more likely toensure accountability. Although civilian criminal investigations are far fromperfect, the civilian justice system has basic safeguards to ensureimpartiality and independence, which the military justice system lacks.Finally, this case shows that victims of abuses play acritical role in these processes by speaking up against the military, which inturn helps them provide some degree of closure. Human Rights Watch interviewedthree women involved in the criminal proceedings (one who was raped andimpregnated by a soldier, another who was sexually abused, and a third whowitnessed the events), and they all agreed that nothing will ever erase fromtheir minds what happened to them.[229]However, they all felt “satisfied” when three men were convictedfor these crimes, and encouraged other victims of military abuses to speak up.It is extremely unlikely that victims would be willing tochallenge their aggressors before military prosecutors and courts. For instance,two of the women interviewed by Human Rights Watch explained that they wouldnot have felt comfortable participating in similar proceedings before militarycourts, since they did not trust they would be impartial. One of the women heldthat participating in the procedure was hard enough, “[so] imagine whatit would have been like with someone who favors them.” Another womanadded she also feared that military courts would be more worried about themilitary’s “image” than about procuring justice.VI. Mexico's Obligations UnderInternational LawObligation to InvestigateAbusesMexico is party to several international treaties thatimpose an obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill the human rights listedin the treaties.[230]Those same treaties also impose on the Mexican state the obligation to deterand prevent violations of those rights, and to investigate, prosecute, andremedy their abuses.[231]This second set of duties is, in part, a corollary to thefirst, reflecting the view that effective protection and prevention requireinvestigation and punishment. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, forexample, has held that “the State has the obligation to use all the legalmeans at its disposal to combat [impunity], since impunity fosters chronicrecidivism of human rights violations and total defenselessness of victims andtheir relatives.”[232]The duty to investigate and punish also derives from the rightto a legal remedy that these treaties extend to victims of human rightsviolations. Under international law, governments have an obligation to providevictims of human rights abuses with an effective remedy—includingjustice, truth, and adequate reparations—after they suffer a violation. Underthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), governmentshave an obligation “to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms asherein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy.”[233]The ICCPR imposes on states the duty to ensure that any person shall have theirright to an effective remedy “determined by competent judicial,administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authorityprovided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilitiesof judicial remedy.”[234]At the regional level, the American Convention on HumanRights (ACHR) states that every individual has “the right to simple andprompt recourse, or any other effective recourse, to a competent court ortribunal for protection against acts that violate his fundamental rightsrecognized by the constitution or laws of the state concerned or by thisConvention, even though such violation may have been committed by personsacting in the course of their official duties.”[235]The Inter-American Court has held that this right imposes an obligation uponstates to provide victims with effective judicial remedies.[236]There are also specific obligations on states to prevent andpunish torture and enforced disappearances. These two heinous crimes have theirown treaties, which codify the obligations of governments, to ensure thatwhenever an offense occurs there is effective investigation and prosecution anda proper remedy for the victim.[237]Obligation to InformIn addition to the obligation to investigate and prosecute,states have an obligation to provide victims with information about theinvestigation into the violations.Victims have a right to know the truth about violations theysuffered. The UN General Assembly has endorsed the principle thatvictims’ right to remedies includes having access to relevant informationconcerning human rights violations.[238]International principles adopted by the former UN Commission on Human Rightsstate that “irrespective of any legal proceedings, victims, theirfamilies and relatives have the imprescriptible right to know the truth aboutthe circumstances in which violations took place.”[239]International human rights bodies have emphasized thestate’s obligation to provide information to victims, particularly incases of enforced disappearance. The UN Human Rights Committee has held thatthe extreme anguish inflicted upon relatives of the “disappeared”makes them direct victims of the violation as well.[240]To the extent the state fails to inform relatives about the fate of the“disappeared,” it fails to fulfill its basic obligation to bring anend to the violation.[241]The recently adopted International Convention for theProtection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (Convention AgainstDisappearances), which Mexico has ratified, sets out the right of eachvictim “to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the enforceddisappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate ofthe disappeared person.” The treaty requires each state party, including Mexico,to take appropriate measures in this regard.[242]Similarly, the Inter-American Court has held thatstates’ obligation to provide reparation to victims of abuses, translatesinto an obligation to provide family members with information about what hashappened to people who have “disappeared.”[243]In addition to informing the victims and their families, thestate has an obligation to inform society in general about human rights abuses,particularly when the violations are serious. This obligation derives partlyfrom its duty to prevent future violations. According to the former UNCommission on Human Rights:Every people has the inalienable right to know the truthabout past events and about the circumstances and reasons which led, throughsystematic, gross violations of human rights, to the perpetrationof heinous crimes. Full and effective exercise of the right to the truthis essential to avoid any recurrence of violations in the future.[244]Similarly, the IACHR has established that “[e]verysociety has the inalienable right to know the truth about past events, as wellas the motives and circumstances in which aberrant crimes came to be committed,in order to prevent repetition of such acts in the future.”[245]The obligation to inform also derives from the right to“seek, receive, and impart” information, recognized in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the ICCPR, and the ACHR.[246]Although to date this has primarily been invoked to prevent states’illegitimate interference or restriction on individuals or the media accessinginformation that is available, there is growing international recognition thatthe right also encompasses a positive obligation of states to provide access toofficial information. Both regional and international organizations have heldthat the right of access to official information is a fundamental right ofevery individual. In theAmericas, the Inter-American Court has held that Article 13 of the ACHR (on theright to freedom of expression) entails the right to receive information heldby government offices, as well as these offices’ obligation to provideit.[247]According to the “Principles on Freedom of InformationLegislation,” endorsed by the UN and Inter-American human rights systems,the right of access to information is governed by the “principle ofmaximum disclosure.”[248]In other words, the government is presumed to be under an obligation todisclose information, a presumption that can be overridden only undercircumstances clearly defined by law, in which the release of information couldundermine the rights of others or the protection of national security, publicorder, or public health or morals.[249]Judicial authorities, as part of government, are subject tothese obligations. According to the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom ofopinion and expression, the OSCE representative on freedom of the media, andthe OAS special rapporteur on freedom of expression, “courts and judicialprocesses, like other public functions, are subject to the principle of maximumdisclosure of information which may be overcome only where necessary to protectthe right to a fair trial or the presumption of innocence.”[250]International Standards onJudicial Independence and ImpartialitySeveral international treaties, including the ICCPR and theACHR, require that individuals be tried by “independent and impartialtribunals.”[251]A series of international principles set criteria to determine whether anyjustice system—including a military one—is in fact independent andimpartial:Judges must be free from constraints, pressures, or ordersimposed by the other branches of government. According to the UN BasicPrinciples on the Independence of the Judiciary (UN Basic Principles),“[i]t is the duty of all governmental and other institutions torespect and observe the independence of the judiciary,”and the judiciary “shall decide matters before them impartially, onthe basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without anyrestrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats orinterferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for anyreason.”[252]Judicial decisions cannot be subject to change by authoritiesother than superior courts. The UN Basic Principles state that“[t]here shall not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interferencewith the judicial process, nor shall judicial decisions by the courts besubject to revision.”[253]Judges should have security of tenure to avoid fear ofbeing removed from their posts for the decisions they adopt. The UN BasicPrinciples state that “[t]he term of office of judges, theirindependence, security, adequate remuneration, conditions of service,pensions and the age of retirement shall be adequately secured bylaw” and that “[j]udges, whether appointed or elected, shallhave guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry oftheir term of office, where such exists.”[254]Judges should have proper training and qualifications,which should be the basis of their appointments. The Universal Charter ofthe Judge points out that “[t]he selection and each appointment of ajudge must be carried out according to objective and transparent criteriabased on proper professional qualification.”[255]International Standards onMilitary JurisdictionThe independence necessary to investigate and prosecutemilitary abuses generally does not exist when military authorities investigatehuman rights violations committed by military personnel and prosecute them inmilitary courts.The only explicit prohibition in international law onmilitary prosecutors investigating, and military courts trying, human rightscases is related to enforced disappearances. The Inter-American Convention onForced Disappearance of Persons states that individuals accused of carrying out“disappearances” should be tried by ordinary courts, “to theexclusion of all other special jurisdictions, particularly militaryjurisdictions.”[256](Mexico made a reservation when ratifying this treaty, stating that itsmilitary justice system may prosecute and investigate crimes, if members of themilitary commit them while on duty. Although the validity of this reservationhas not yet been studied by international bodies, Human Rights Watch believesit contradicts the object and purpose of the treaty.)[257]The Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearancesincludes a similar provision.[258]International human rights bodies have consistently rejectedthe use of military prosecutors and courts in cases involving abuses againstcivilians, by stating that the jurisdiction of military courts should belimited to offenses that are strictly military in nature.The UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), which monitorsimplementation of the states’ obligations under the ICCPR, has repeatedlycalled on states parties to subject military personnel, alleged to havecommitted human rights violations, to civilian jurisdiction.[259]According to the Committee, the “wide jurisdiction of the military courtsto deal with all the cases involving prosecution of military personnel ... contribute[s]to the impunity which such personnel enjoy against punishment for serious humanrights violations.”[260]The IACHR has held that military jurisdiction is notappropriate for investigating, trying, and punishing violations of humanrights, given that “when the State permits investigations to be conductedby the entities with possible involvement, independence and impartiality are clearlycompromised.”[261]The result, concludes the commission, is “de facto impunity which‘has a corrosive effect on the rule of law and violates the principles ofthe American Convention.’”[262]The Inter American Court of Human Rights, for its part, hasstated that military jurisdiction should have a “restrictive andexceptional scope.”[263]A “restrictive” jurisdictional scope would require that civiliansbe excluded and that military personnel only be tried by military tribunalswhen they are charged with crimes or offenses which “by [their] ownnature attempt against legally protected interests of military order.”[264]Failure to transfer such cases to civilian jurisdiction results in a breach ofthe state’s guarantee to an effective recourse.[265]In 2007 the Inter American Court further developed its case law and concludedthat “the military criminal jurisdiction is not the competentjurisdiction to investigate and, if applicable, prosecute and punish theperpetrators of human rights violations.”[266] Thisview has been upheld in several subsequent decisions.[267]The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has not ruled thatmilitary courts lack independence and impartiality per se, but hassuggested certain instances in which military courts are not appropriate. Forinstance, in Incal v. Turkey,the ECHR held that a petitioner hadnot been given a fair trial because the military judge who had taken part inthe trial was accountable to the executive and military authorities, and hissuperiors were in a position to advance his career.[268]In Findlay v. United Kingdom, the ECHR reasoned that for a ruling to beindependent and impartial, it has to have some degree of finality. It foundthat a military court’s ruling was neither independent nor impartial,because the members of the court who issued the decision were subordinates ofthe prosecuting officer, who had the authority to change any decision that thecourt made.[269]Finally, sets of principles presented before the formerUnited Nations Human Rights Commission, which are non-binding guidelines forstates, also recommend that human rights cases be transferred to civiliancourts. The Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rightsthrough Action to Combat Impunity, presented before the commission in 2005,state that “the jurisdiction of military tribunals must be restrictedsolely to specifically military offenses committed by military personnel, tothe exclusion of human rights violations, which shall come under thejurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or, where appropriate, in the caseof serious crimes under international law, of an international orinternationalized criminal court.”[270] Similarly, theDraft Principles Governing the Administration of Justice through MilitaryTribunals, presented to the commission in January 2006, state that “inall circumstances, the jurisdiction of military courts should be set aside infavour of the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to conduct inquiries intoserious human rights violations such as extrajudicial executions, enforceddisappearances and torture, and to prosecute and try persons accused of suchcrimes.”[271]International Decisions onMexico’s Military Justice SystemMexico violates its international obligations by allowingits military justice system to investigate, prosecute, and try members of themilitary accused of committing human rights violations. Over the last decadeseveral United Nations rapporteurs and bodies, as well as the IACHR, haveissued reports documenting the lack of independence and impartiality inMexico’s military justice system, and the consequent impunity of humanrights abuses investigated by military courts. Therefore, they haveconsistently called on Mexico to transfer human rights cases to civiliancourts. These reports include:A 1998 report by the UN special rapporteur on torture,which found that "[m]ilitary personnel [in Mexico] appear to beimmune from civilian justice and generally protected by militaryjustice.”[272]A 1999 report by the U.N. special rapporteur onextrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which determined thatmilitary courts in Mexico “do not conform to the Basic Principles onthe Independence of the Judiciary,” that “the military justicesystem is arbitrary, resulting in miscarriage of justice,” and that“there is a reluctance on the part of the competent Mexicanauthorities to hold members of the military forces accountable forextrajudicial killings and other human rights violations.”[273]A 2002 report by the U.N. special rapporteur on theindependence of judges and lawyers, which found that “the public[has] no confidence in military courts” and thus “manyprosecutions of military personnel accused of human rights violationsbefore these tribunals are not pursued.”[274]The rapporteur also expressed concern over “the want of impartialityof the military courts and the reluctance or unwillingness of civilianwitnesses to appear before military courts to give evidence againstmilitary personnel.”[275]A 2003 report by the office of the UN High Commissionerfor Human Rights, which concluded that “given the imminentlyhierarchical structure of the Armed Forces, military courts lack totalindependence and impartiality due to the fact that its members …report to higher ranking officers in the Army.”[276]A 2006 report by the U.N. special rapporteur on violenceagainst women, its causes and consequences, which held that afterasserting jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute cases in which membersof the military had raped women in southern Mexico, “rather thancarrying out full and impartial investigations, military investigatorshave reportedly delayed criminal proceedings and tried to disprove theallegations thereby placing the burden of proof on the victim.”[277]A 2006 report by the IACHR, which held that Mexicanmilitary prosecutors lack “by definition, the necessary independenceand autonomy to carry out an impartial investigation of human rightsviolations allegedly committed by members of the armed forces.” Thecommission concluded that “the investigation by the [militaryprosecutor’s office] of human rights violations allegedlyperpetrated by Mexican military personnel is itself a violation of theAmerican Convention.”[278]A 2007 report by the United Nations Committee AgainstTorture, which “noted with concern” that “cases oftorture committed by military personnel against civilians during theperformance of their duties continue to be tried in militarycourts.”[279]More recently, after a 2008 visit to Mexico, the UN HighCommissioner for Human Rights also recommended that civilian courts trymilitary officers engaged in law enforcement activities.[280]AcknowledgmentsThis report was written by Tamara Taraciuk, Mexicoresearcher in the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.

The interview was conducted at the Ministry of ForeignAffairs, during a meeting with senior officials of the PGR, the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Interior.[23]Under Mexican law, binding jurisprudence may be created in two different ways.The Supreme Court creates binding jurisprudence when it issues five consecutivedecisions (called “thesis”) that reach the same conclusion or whenit interprets a law that has been interpreted differently by lower leveltribunals (called “contradiction of thesis”). Amparo Law (Ley deAmparo), http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/19/default.htm?s= (accessedFebruary 2, 2009), art. 192.For example, in 1961 the Supreme Court ruled thatcivilian authorities may investigate a homicide in a case in which it had notbeen proven that the member of the military accused of the crime was “in service”when the homicide occurred. Supreme Court, Sixth Period, ThesisNo. 258,081, Semanario Judicial de la Federación, vol. LIV, 1961,p. 175. The Supreme Court adopted other similar decisions. Supreme Court, FifthPeriod, Thesis No. 384175, Semanario Judicial de la Federación, vol.CXXVI, 1955, p. 237; Supreme Court, Fifth Period, Thesis No. 278085, SemanarioJudicial de la Federación, vol. CXXVI, 1955, p. 480; Supreme Court, Fifth Period, Thesis No.294451, Semanario Judicial de la Federación, vol. CXXVI,1955, p. 733.Also in 1961, the Supreme Court held that militarycourts were competent to investigate military abuses against civilians, as theyhad been committed while the accused was on duty. Supreme Court,Sixth Period, Thesis No. 804058, Semanario Judicial de la Federación, vol. XLI, 1961, p. 210.[24]Mexican Supreme Court, Jurisprudence, “Contradiction ofThesis” (Contradicción de Tesis) 105/2005-PS, September 28, 2005.The original language in Spanish is: “realización de las funcionespropias e inherentes al cargo que desempeña.”[25]Jurists have offered several arguments in supportof the view that, in light of an analysis of Article 13 of the MexicanConstitution as a whole, civilian courts have jurisdiction to address thesecases.The first is that themere fact that the victim is a civilian is enough to prohibit the use ofmilitary courts to investigate these cases. Human Rights Watch interview withMiguel Carbonell Sánchez, constitutional law expert and researcher andcoordinator of the Constitutional Law section, Institute of JuridicalInvestigations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City,November 19, 2008.

Human Rights Watch interview with Manuel Oropeza, magistrate,Federal Electoral Tribunal, Mexico City, November 18, 2008.A second argument isthat military courts may not exercise jurisdiction over civilian victims, sincethe Constitution was modified to recognize victims’ rights in its Article20(C), and those rights cannot be adequately fulfilled in the military system.These rights include the right to be informed of the progress of theproceedings, to collaborate with prosecutors investigating the case(coadyuvancia), to receive urgent medical and psychological attention, and thepossibility to appeal certain decisions adopted by prosecutors. Human RightsWatch email communication with Miguel Sarre, professor, InstitutoTecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), Mexico City,November 18 and 26, 2007.A third argument is that“the nature of the offense” determines which justice system hasjurisdiction to investigate a case, and whenever a case involves a common crimeagainst a civilian (and not strictly a breach of military discipline),civilian courts have jurisdiction to address it. Human Rights Watch interviewwith Sergio García Ramírez, judge of the Inter-American Court ofHuman Rights and permanent researcher at the Institute of JuridicalInvestigations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City,January 12, 2009.Finally, somepractitioners argue that, since the Code of Military Justice did not go throughthe appropriate process for approval of legislation, the entire code isunconstitutional. (The Code of Military Justice was issued by General AbelardoL. Rodríguez, acting president in 1933, using extraordinary powers assertedby the executive at that time, and it was never approved by the MexicanCongress.) According to this view, since the code was not adopted by Congress,it should not be deemed a legally binding interpretation of Article 13 of theConstitution.

The military justice system’sbenefits for the accused include, according to the lawyer, much better prisonconditions (“military prisons are a luxury”), lower sentences, higherchances of obtaining conditional liberty after paying bail, and the possibilityof continuing to receive a salary as a member of the armed forces (even if a slightlylower one).

AMexican lawyer went to the Military Camp No 1-A on February 18, 2009, to requestinformation on public hearings and observe a hearing held that day. The lawyerwas able to enter the military premises after showing her professionalidentification, and requested information on hearings occurring that day in sixmilitary courts. Only one military court had a board with information onhearings that would be held that week.The only judge who had ahearing that day asked the lawyer where she worked, where she had studied, ifshe was a journalist, why she was interested in being present in a hearing, andif she had family members in the military. The judge stated that to observe anordinary court-martial, it was normally necessary to obtain previousauthorization from SEDENA, but authorized the lawyer to be present during ahearing before the judge that was going to be held that day. The hearing wascancelled at the last minute.[53]Seechapter IV, which analyzes recent military investigations into human rightsabuses documented by the CNDH.[54]SEDENA provided HumanRights Watch with partial or inaccurate information on the cases of militaryabuses documented by CNDH in 2007 and 2008.

The official name of theoffice was Special Prosecutor’s Office for Social and Political Movementsof the Past (Fiscalía Especial para movimientos sociales y políticosdel pasado, FEMOSPP).In October of 2000, Tita Radilla Martínez fileda new criminal case before federal prosecutors in Chilpancingo, Guerrero, whichwas eventually investigated by the Special Prosecutors’ Office. TitaRadilla also filed another formal complaint with representatives of the SpecialProsecutors’ Office in Guerrero in May 2002. IACHR, “Brief beforethe Inter-American Court on Human Rights against the United States of Mexico.Case 12.511. Rosendo Radilla Pacheco,” March 15, 2008, section D.[65]Initially, due to fear of the consequences that they could suffer if theypresented a formal complaint before government authorities, the Radilla familymembers limited their actions to trying to find Rosendo by visiting the stategovernor’s office, a family member who was a military official, andmilitary installations in the area to inquire about Rosendo’swhereabouts, and by participating in demonstrations. Two of Rosendo’sdaughters had asked federal and state prosecutors in 1992 and 1999 toinvestigate the case, but the investigations were closed due to lack ofevidence to determine who could be responsible for the crimes. (One ofRosendo’s daughters, Andrea, brought the case to a federal prosecutor inChilpancingo, Guerrero, in March 1992. Another one of his daughters, Tita,brought the case to a state prosecutor in Atoyac de Álvarez, Guerrero,in May 1999.) Ibid., paras. 33, 64.[66]Theprosecutor argued that, although Quirós Hermosillo was a retired memberof the armed forces, there was no evidence that this case constituted a breachof military discipline. Therefore, this was not a case that, under Article 13of the Mexican Constitution, could be investigated and tried by the militaryjustice system. The military judge thus asked the Supreme Court to determinewhich justice system should investigate this case, and the Supreme Court returnedthe case to a lower federal court for it to rule on the merits of the request.[67]FirstCollegiate Tribunal in Criminal and Administrative Matters in the 21st Circuit(Primer Tribunal Colegiado en Materias Penal y Administrativa delVigésimo Primer Circuito), Judge Xochitl Guido Guzmán,Jurisdictional Conflict 6/2005, October 27, 2005.[68]IACHR,“Brief before the Inter-American Court on Human Rights against the UnitedStates of Mexico.

The IACHR admittedthe case in 2005, and two years later concluded that Mexico was responsible forthe detention, torture, and subsequent“disappearance” of Rosendo Radilla. The commission also statedMexico had failed to inform Radilla’s family of his whereabouts, and toadequately investigate the case and prosecute those responsible. GivenMexico’s failure to, among other measures, conduct a thorough, impartialand prompt investigation into the case and determine Rosendo’swhereabouts, the IACHR filed a case against Mexico before the Inter-AmericanCourt on Human Rights in March of 2008.

With that organization, the two menhad been engaged in efforts to bring an end to illegal deforestation in theregion.The army gave a different account of events inPizotla. It claimed that soldiers on a counternarcotics patrol had learned ofan armed band operating in the region. Arriving in Pizotla, they saw five armedmen run out of a house and open fire on them. They returned the fire, killingone of the men, Salomé Sánchez Ortiz. The other four men fled.The soldiers were able to cut off the escape of Montiel and Cabrera and, aftera standoff of several hours, to force their surrender. The two were still armedwhen they were captured, and once in custody, Cabrera told them that he had amarijuana field five kilometers away. They found a gun at the side of the deadman, along with a sack containing marijuana and poppy seeds. First Tribunal ofthe 21st Circuit (Primer Tribunal Unitario del Vigésimo Primer Circuito),Toca Penal 406/2000, October 26, 2000, pp. 528-30.If the army’s account of the events is true, thedetention was legal: Montiel and Cabrera (and the dead man, SaloméSánchez Ortiz) were caught “in fraganti,” shooting at thesoldiers with illegal weapons. However, there is substantial evidence that,independently of what led to their detention, Montiel and Cabrera were subjectto the human rights abuses described in this section.[85]CNDH, Recommendation 8/2000, July 14, 2000. According to Montiel andCabrera’s legal representatives, the two men stated that they had beendetained until May 6, and that they were not presented before state prosecutorson May 4. Human Rights Watch email exchange with Santiago Aguirre, lawyer,Centro Prodh, February 9, 2009.[86]Since military prosecutors did not provide the CNDH with the informationincluded in their investigations of the alleged torture, the CNDH concludedthat the military had not refuted Montiel and Cabrera’s allegations andthus concluded they had been tortured. The CNDH also concluded the two men weresubjected to prolonged illegal detention since the military had failed to turnthe prisoners over to civilian authorities as soon as they could. Article 16 ofthe Mexican Constitution provides that civilians detained “in fraganti”must be turned over to the public ministry “without delay.” TheCNDH found that the army had violated that constitutional provision when it didnot use helicopters it had at its disposal to transport Montiel and Cabrerafrom Pizotla on the day they were detained. CNDH, Recommendation 8/2000,July 14, 2000.[87]The judge sentenced Montiel to six years and eight months in prison on onedrugs charge and two weapons charges, and Cabrera to ten years in prison on oneweapons charge. The conviction provoked an outpouring of complaints from localand international nongovernmental organizations. In January 2001 former PresidentFox responded to these complaints by promising that his government wouldconduct a thorough investigation of the case. After a federal court upheld theconviction of Montiel and Cabrera in July 2001, they remained in prison untilNovember, when former President Fox issued an order for their release as a signalof his government’s commitment to human rights norms.[88]The soldiers claimed, for instance, that Montiel had two guns in his possessionwhen detained. However, the initial internal army report, issued by thecommander of the 35th Military Zone out of which the soldiers operated on May2, 1999, stated that Montiel had only one gun. The agent of the public ministrywho conducted a visual inspection in Pizotla on May 5, 1999, did not reporthaving seen any guns on Montiel. CNDH, Recommendation 08/2000, July 14,2000.The soldiers also testified that the prisoners did notaccompany the soldiers to the marijuana field, which raises the question ofhow they knew the marijuana field belonged to Montiel. The soldiers claimedthat the prisoners had told them they were members of the EZLN, which seemssuspect given that the EZLN did not operate in Guerrero.

First they arguedthat the military code became a law through an unconstitutional process,because it was issued by the Mexican president without ever being approved bythe nation’s legislative branch. Second, they contended that the Code ofMilitary Justice—particularly article 57—violates article 13 of theMexican Constitution, which clearly states that any violation by the militaryinvolving a civilian should be tried in civilian courts. Third, they arguedthat the military justice system lacks the proper foundation and motives tojudge such cases, and that it is inherently biased. Fourth, they charged that themilitary justice system does not adequately protect the rights of victims. Andfifth, they claim it violates international norms guaranteed by treaties Mexicohas signed and ratified.[200]The reports in both cases were prepared by Brigadier General of MilitaryJustice Rogelio Rodríguez.

Theinformation should be provided without the need to prove direct interest orpersonal involvement in order to obtain it, except in cases in which alegitimate restriction is applied. The delivery of information to an individualcan, in turn, permit it to circulate in society, so that the latter can becomeacquainted with it, have access to it, and assess it. In this way, the right tofreedom of thought and expression includes the protection of the right ofaccess to State-held information, which also clearly includes the two dimensions,individual and social, of the right to freedom of thought and expression thatmust be guaranteed simultaneously by the State.”[248]Principle 1 of The Public’s Right to Know:Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation holds that “[t]heprinciple that all information held by public bodies should be subject todisclosure and that this presumption may be overcome only in very limitedcircumstances.” The Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation wereadopted in June 1999 by Article XIX, an NGO working on freedom of expressionand access to information, in consultation with organizations in differentcountries (http://www.article19.org/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf; accessedFebruary 20, 2009).
