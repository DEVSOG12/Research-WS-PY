The Human Rights Watch report provides the first in-depth look at the patterns of abuse in a conflict that remains virtually unknown because of severe restrictions imposed by the Ethiopian government.SummaryTens of thousands of ethnic Somali civilians living ineastern Ethiopia's SomaliRegionalState are experiencingserious abuses and a looming humanitarian crisis in the context of alittle-known conflict between the Ethiopian government and an Ethiopian Somalirebel movement. The situation is critical. Since mid-2007, thousands of peoplehave fled, seeking refuge in neighboring Somaliaand Kenyafrom widespread Ethiopian military attacks on civilians and villages thatamount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.For those who remain in the war-affected area, continuingabuses by both rebels and Ethiopian troops pose a direct threat to theirsurvival and create a pervasive culture of fear. The Ethiopian militarycampaign of forced relocations and destruction of villages reduced in early2008 compared to its peak in mid-2007, but other abuses-including arbitrarydetentions, torture, and mistreatment in detention-are continuing. These arecombining with severe restrictions on movement and commercial trade, minimalaccess to independent relief assistance, a worsening drought, and rising foodprices to create a highly vulnerable population at risk of humanitariandisaster.Although the conflict has been simmering for years withintermittent allegations of abuses, it took on dramatic new momentum after theOgaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) attacked a Chinese-run oil installationin Somali Region in April 2007, killing more than 70 Chinese and Ethiopiancivilians. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)government, led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, responded by launching a brutalcounter-insurgency campaign in the five zones of Somali Region primarilyaffected by the conflict: Fiiq, Korahe, Gode, Wardheer, and Dhagahbur. In these zones the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) havedeliberately and repeatedly attacked civilian populations in an effort to rootout the insurgency.Ethiopian troops have forcibly displaced entire ruralcommunities, ordering villagers to leave their homes within a few days orwitness their houses being burnt down and their possessions destroyed-and riskdeath. Over the past year, Human Rights Watch has documented the execution of morethan 150 individuals, many of them in demonstration killings, with Ethiopiansoldiers singling out relatives of suspected ONLF members, or making apparentlyarbitrary judgments that individuals complaining to soldiers or resisting theirorders are ONLF supporters. These executions have sometimes involvedstrangulation, after which their bodies are left lying in the open as awarning, for villagers to bury. The information confirmed by Human Rights Watchis only a glimpse of what is taking place-real figures are likely to behigher.Mass detentions without any judicial oversight are routine.Hundreds-and possibly thousands-of individuals have been arrested and held inmilitary barracks, sometimes multiple times, where they have been tortured,raped, and assaulted. Confiscation of livestock (the main asset among thelargely pastoralist population), restrictions on access to water, food, andother essential commodities, and obstruction of commercial traffic andhumanitarian assistance have been used as weapons in an economic war aimed atcutting off ONLF supplies and collectively punishing communities that aresuspected of supporting the rebels.These crimes are being committed with total impunity, on thethinnest of pretexts. They are generating a perception in the area that simplybeing an ethnic Somali-and particularly a member of the Ogaadeeni clan whichconstitutes the backbone of the ONLF-is enough to render a person suspect inthe eyes of the national government. As one young man told Human Rights Watch,"Anyone with a bowl of water is suspected of supplying the ONLF."Ethiopian military personnel who ordered or participated inattacks on civilians should be held responsible for war crimes. Senior militaryand civilian officials who knew or should have known of such crimes but took noaction may be criminally liable as a matter of command responsibility. Thewidespread and apparently systematic nature of the attacks on villagesthroughout Somali Region is strong evidence that the killings, torture, rape,and forced displacement are also crimes against humanity for which theEthiopian government bears ultimate responsibility.The ONLF has also been responsible for serious violations ofinternational humanitarian law (the laws of war). These include the summary executionof dozens of Chinese and Ethiopian civilians in the context of its April 2007attack on the oil installation, the ONLF practice of killing suspectedgovernment collaborators, and the indiscriminate mining of roads used by governmentconvoys. Those who ordered or carried out such acts are responsible for warcrimes. Many civilians feel trapped with no refuge from ONLF pressure or theabuses by Ethiopian troops.The Ethiopian government has repeatedly dismissed orminimized concerns about the human rights and humanitarian situation in SomaliRegion. It often claims, particularly to the international audience, thatinsecurity in the region is the work of Eritrean-backed "terrorists" seeking todestabilize Ethiopia.There is no question that the political dynamics in Somali Region intertwinewith regional dynamics and are influenced by the continuing hostility between Eritrea and Ethiopiaas well as events in neighboring Somalia. The application ofterrorist rhetoric to the internal conflict with the ONLF, however, appearsdesigned mainly to attract support from the United States as part of the "waron terror." It does not justify violations of international human rights andhumanitarian law.The government faces complex challenges in Somali Region.The ONLF, which claims to be seeking self-determination for the region,represents only a segment of the divided Ethiopian Somali community. There arelegitimate fears that the escalating conflict across the border in Somalia could spill into Ethiopia. The authorities facedifficult questions on how to best establish the rule of law in a remote,poverty-stricken region largely inhabited by pastoralists who have littleknowledge of or confidence in state institutions that have long neglected them.Instead of addressing these challenges in good faith with efforts to buildinstitutions and accountability to support the rule of law and reduce theappeal of armed groups, the government has implemented violent repression,echoing the response to the region of previous Ethiopian administrations.The Ethiopian government's reaction to reports of abuses in2007 has been to deny the allegations, disparage the sources, and activelyrestrict or control access to the region by journalists, human rights groups,and aid organizations (including by expelling the International Committee ofthe Red Cross in July 2007).Due to increasing alarm over humanitarian conditions,particularly malnutrition rates among children, the UN and some nongovernmentalorganizations were permitted to expand humanitarian programs in parts of theregion in late 2007, a small positive step. However these operations have been limitedto certain geographic areas, are vulnerable to constant government threats andharassment, are sometimes unable to operate with sufficient independence fromgovernment control, and have no protection mandate or capacity to respond tothe attacks on civilians which remain the biggest priority for many affectedcommunities.The Ethiopian government's politicized manipulation ofhumanitarian operations, particularly food distribution, plus the continuedrestrictions on commercial traffic and trade are creating a situation that-incombination with the drought produced by failed rains-could quickly slip intocatastrophe. The Ethiopian government should take urgent action to ensure thatthe needs of vulnerable civilians in Somali Region are prioritized, includingin emergency appeals. Yet due to government obstruction and restrictions onaccess to conflict-affected zones, humanitarian agencies cannot even conductthe independent nutritional assessments needed to fully assess the scale andformulate a proper response to the potential crisis.The international response to the situation ranges frominsipid to disingenuous. Western governments, including the US, UK, andEuropean Union, which cumulatively provide almost US$2 billion of aid toEthiopia every year and rely on the Ethiopian government as a key ally in avolatile region, have sent a number of delegations to the region but haverefrained from even mild public concern, much less criticism. The USgovernment, which is a staunch Ethiopian ally-particularly in counter-terrorismefforts-and has probably the greatest leverage of any of the donor governments,has minimized and possibly actively ignored internal concerns and reporting onthe situation.Instead of maintaining the complicity of silence, donorgovernments should start using their leverage to insist on three sets ofimmediate actions in Somali Region. Full recommendations are given below.First, both the Ethiopiangovernment and the ONLF should support full, unhindered and immediate access tothe region for independent aid organizations, the media, and human rightsgroups, and the government should lift restrictions on commercial trade andcivilian and livestock movement, including across the border with Somaliland. Implementing this recommendation would havean immediate positive effect on civilian access to water and grazing for theirlivestock, food, and local markets and could mitigate the impending foodcrisis.  Humanitarian organizationsshould also have immediate, unimpeded access to conduct independent nutritionalsurveys in all affected areas and properly monitor food distribution to ensure itis not diverted.Second, the Ethiopian government should immediately issueclear public orders to the armed forces and all other security agencies inSomali Region to cease abuses of civilians, including the military's forcedrelocations, extrajudicial executions, mass detentions, and mistreatment ofdetainees. The ONLF should also cease killings of civilians, includinggovernment officials, desist from the indiscriminate use of mines along keyroads in Somali Region and publicly commit to abide by internationalhumanitarian law.Third, Ethiopian authorities should establish an independentcommission of inquiry to investigate the allegations of abuses by all partiesto the conflict and begin short and long-term efforts to ensure accountabilityfor abuses by government security forces in Somali Region and elsewhere,including judicial and security sector reforms.Rapid implementation of these recommendations could help toavert catastrophe in Somali Region. If the abuses continue, denied by theEthiopian government and ignored by international donors, the outcome is alltoo clear: yet another cycle of human rights devastation, famine, andimpoverishment in a region which already knows these trends all too well, andthousandsof newvictims, embittered by the repeated denial of their rights as human beings andEthiopians.Map 1: Ethiopiaand SomaliRegionalStateClick to expand ImageMap 2:Conflict-Affected Zones of SomaliRegionalState-MethodologyThis report is based largely on interviews with Ethiopianrefugees in countries neighboring Ethiopia. The Ethiopian governmentdoes not officially bar the media or human rights organizations from SomaliRegion, and parts of it, including the regional capital, Jijiga, are accessibleto visitors. However, the region's five main conflict-affected zones-Fiiq,Wardheer, Dhagahbur, Gode, and Korahe-are under tight military control.Foreigners traveling into this area generally come under close scrutiny, andinternational journalists who have attempted to research stories have regularlybeen arrested. Residents of the region, like many other Ethiopians, fear thepervasive state security apparatus. This oppressive atmosphere makes conductingon-site research into human rights abuses an especially difficult task, notleast because of the security risks to victims and witnesses.Human Rights Watch repeatedly requested by letter that theEthiopian government permit access to the conflict-affected region, butreceived no response. Because of the severe restrictions and the dangers thatwould be faced by Ethiopian staff and individuals we sought to interview, HumanRights Watch decided not to attempt to access conflict-affected zones.Human Rights Watch researchersinstead located and interviewed recent refugees from the conflict inneighboring countries, including Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti. During Septemberand October 2007, Human Rights Watch researchers conducted a month-long fieldmission to Kenya (Nairobi, Garissa, and several refugee camps around Dadaab)and Hargeysa, Somaliland, where we interviewedmore than 70 victims and eyewitnesses of abuses, as well as traders, businessleaders, and officials originating from Somali Region. Human Rights Watchresearchers also conducted a short research trip to Addis Ababa to interview individuals fromSomali Region.Finally, telephone and in-personinterviews were conducted with dozens of additional victims, eyewitnesses, ONLFrepresentatives, regional government officials, journalists, pro-governmentmilitia leaders, and aid officials in a variety of locations, including inSomali Region, Addis Ababa, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, and Europe.Human Rights Watch also sought out persons with particularprofiles, such as traders and livestock herders active on the Ethiopian-Somalitrading routes for information on trading restrictions, community leaders andregional officials for information on the political dynamics, and scholars andindependent analysts with insights into the region's complex history. InNovember 2007 and March 2008 Human Rights Watch wrote to Prime Minister MelesZenawi and other Ethiopian officials, presented preliminary research findingsand requested information on the situation in Somali Region and meetings withEthiopian federal officials. We also sought further details of allegations ofONLF abuses and the opportunity to interview victims of ONLF attacks in Ethiopia,but to date we have not received any response to these requests.To the extent possible, all interviews were conducted inprivate, including in the refugee camps, with only the Human Rights Watchresearcher, the interviewee, and (when necessary) a trained interpreterpresent. Interviewees were asked only to relate events that they personallyexperienced and witnessed. When allegations of abuse were made duringinterviews, the interviewees were again asked if they personally witnessed orexperienced those abuses. Careful notes were taken during all interviews, andare on file with Human Rights Watch.For the security of witnesses and their relatives who remainin Ethiopia,the names of most witnesses have been withheld, and other details such as theage, gender, and occupation have been changed where necessary to protect theiridentities. In some interviews the date and location of the interview isomitted if this could present a security risk to the witness. Ethiopianintelligence officials are active in many locations where Ethiopian refugeesreside, including Kenya andthe semi-autonomous Somaliland region of northern Somalia. In Somaliland inparticular, there have been repeated incidents in which local authorities havedetained refugees and forcibly returned them (under arrest) to Ethiopia,under pressure from Ethiopian security services.In order to further corroboratethe widespread allegations of extensive village burnings in Somali Region,Human Rights Watch worked with the Science and Human Rights Program of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science to obtain "before" and"after" satellite images of villages that had been reportedly burned. Aninitial list of 87 villages that had been reported to Human Rights Watch tohave been burned was compiled, and from that list, villages whose exactcoordinates could be established were selected as candidates for imageacquisition. A further selection was made based on the availability of "before"images for each of those locations, as well as the strength of the eyewitnessaccounts from those villages.For villages mentioned in this report as burned, a total of11 sets of "before" and "after" images were selected. These images werereviewed for signs consistent with the reporting provided by Human RightsWatch, and in eight cases the imagery did provide indications of structuralremoval and, sometimes, burning. Special care was taken to differentiatenomadic settlements from permanent towns, and to identify changes in thosetowns associated with traditional nomadic migration rather than violentattacks. Ultimately, image analysis focused on the permanent towns only, giventhe difficulties of assessing nomadic populations from satellite imagery.Resulting images are highlighted in this report, and more details are availablein a corresponding report released by AAAS.The incidents detailed in this report are only a fraction ofthe information on abuses obtained by Human Rights Watch and largely focus onevents in 2007, although there is credible evidence that many of the patternsof abuses are continuing. Human Rights Watch regrets the lack of cooperationfrom the Ethiopian authorities in our investigation. Despite our lack of accessto Somali Region, this report presents unequivocal evidence from victims andeyewitnesses of numerous serious crimes in Somali Region in violation ofinternational law. Further independent field investigations are urgently neededto address the crimes documented in this report and provide comprehensivedocumentation for future accountability mechanisms.***Note on TerminologyIn this report Human Rights Watch uses the currentadministrative terms "Region 5" (known as kililamist in Amharic), "SomaliRegionalState,"and "Somali Region" interchangeably to describe Ethiopia's eastern Somali state.Where the term "Ogaden" or "Ogaden area" is used, it refers to eitherhistorical usage, or to the smaller geographic area within Somali Region whichis largely although far from exclusively inhabited by ethnic Somali members ofthe Ogaadeen clan.The Ogaden area roughlycorresponds to five of Somali Region's nine zones: Fiiq, Korahe, Dhagahbur,Gode, and Wardheer. The remaining zones-Shinile, Jijiga, Afder, andLiben-incorporate the colonial area known as the Haud, located north of theOgaden along the border with Somaliland, and parts of former EasternHararghe and Bale.In order to distinguish the clan from the geographic area,in this report the term "Ogaadeen" is used to describe the clan, a member ofthe Darood clan family, which contains numerous sub-clans represented acrossthe Horn of Africa.Place names present a challenge in Somali Region. For manyyears the Somali language had no written form and different spellingconventions were used by Italian and British colonial authorities. In 1972 theSomali Language Commission decided to use a Roman script for the written formof Somali, but included the letters "c" and "x" to represent the Somali sounds"'ayn" and "h" respectively.Contemporary sources and maps of Somali Region often mixthree or more different spellings of geographic locations and ethnic Somalinames. For example, alternative spellings of Dhagahbur include Degeh Bur,Dagahbur, Degehabur, and the Somali spelling, Dhagaxbuur. This report generallyuses English spellings for locations unless the Somali version appears to bemore commonly used in Somali Region and on relevant maps. In some cases wheretwo variants are used by different sources, such as Aado/Caado or Yu'ub/Yucub,this report notes both spellings.Part 1: BackgroundIn April 2007, a low-intensity conflict between theEthiopian government and an insurgency movement called the Ogaden NationalLiberation Front (ONLF),[1]made international news when the rebelsattacked an oil site in SomaliRegionalState,in southeast Ethiopia,capturing and killing more than 70 Chinese and Ethiopian oil workers as well asscores of Ethiopian soldiers. Although the ONLF attack sparked internationalattention to the region for the first time in decades, Ethiopia's Somali Region has been alocus of conflict for more than a century.Although geographically within Ethiopia,the Somali Region's ethnic Somali population remains culturally andeconomically intertwined with neighboring Somalia. Conflicts within and overthe region have evolved in tandem with many of the 20th century'smost significant national and regional developments in the Horn of Africa.These include the colonial era division of the Horn's Somali peoples among whateventually became four different countries[2]; thecreation of Somaliain 1960 and the resulting spur to Somali secessionist movements in neighboringcountries; and the 1991 collapse of the Somali state led by Mohamed Siad Barre,just 30 years after its creation.A detailed examination of the many complex and contentiousevents that have influenced the dynamics in Somali Region is beyond the scopeof this report. However, the following chapters identify in brief key,background factors and trace the most significant events influencing theevolution of the current armed conflict.Political and Historical ContextThe People and the AreaPrecise demographic data isdifficult to obtain but it is estimated that approximately four million ethnicSomalis, largely pastoralists or agro-pastoralists, and almost entirely Muslim,currently inhabit Ethiopia'sSomali Region.[3]It is one of Ethiopia'spoorest states, with some of the lowest literacy rates and levels of servicesin the country. Geographically on the periphery, the region's lack ofinfrastructure, weak administrative structures, and pervasive historicalmistrust of what many Somalis perceive as "habasha"or Ethiopian "highlander" dominated culture have all contributed to anambivalent affiliation with the Ethiopian polity and national identity.Many Ethiopian Somalis share mistrust of the federalgovernment and a sense of marginalization from their rightful national share ofservices and development. Since the regional government was established in1992, the lack of confidence has increasingly included regional as well asfederal institutions. While the federal government has made attempts to developSomali Region, regional governments have frequently failed to absorb and spendavailable funds due to insufficient capacity, corruption, and other problems.Beyond this general disillusionment with state structures,however, Somali communities at the regional and local levels are often deeplydivided by clan, political, ideological, and resource-based tensions. All ofthe major Somali clan families are found in Somali Region. The Somali Daroodare the largest clan family numerically-with the Darood Ogaadeen clan estimatedto be the largest single clan, constituting perhaps 40 to 50 percent ofEthiopian Somalis. Non-Ogaadeeni Darood such as the Marehan, and other clanfamilies including the Dir (Isse), Isaaq, Hawiye, Bantu, and Rahaweyn alsoinhabit Somali Region.The Ogaadeen clan of the Darood clanfamily mostly inhabit the central Ogaden plateau of Somali Region, orthe administrative zones called Fiiq, Dhagahbur, Gode, Korahe, and Wardheer,along with other non-Ogaadeeni clans. The Issa live in the area north of theHareghe highlands north of Dire Dawa (today called Shinile zone), and the Isaaqinhabit the prized pasture land known in the colonial era as the Haud, on theborder with Somaliland, as well as parts of the Ogaden.The division between Ogaadeeni and non-Ogaadeeni clans-andthe historical fear among many non-Ogaadeeni clans of Ogaadeeni dominance-is animportant fault line in the region's dynamics, affecting affiliation to thevarious armed opposition groups, competition for power sharing, and thestrategies used by the federal government to suppress opposition.The Ogaden and Somali Nationalism in the Colonial EraSomali political struggle in the Horn of Africa has a longhistory and the area known as the Ogaden, which constitutes a key part ofSomali Region, has had a pivotal role in that history. As early as 1899, theDervish fighters of Sayyid Mohammed Abdulle Hassan launched a 20-year struggleagainst British, Italian, and Ethiopian occupiers, retaking control of much ofthe Ogaden and other Somali territories before finally suffering defeat at thehands of British forces in 1921.[4]The territory was also the subject of an intense powerstruggle during the colonial period, pitting the competing claims of Ethiopia(then called Abyssinia), whose Emperor Menelik II first extended his claim tothe region in 1887,[5]against the colonial powers Italy and Britain. When the Italian militaryinvaded Abyssinia in 1936, the Ogaden regionwas incorporated into the Italian East African Empire. Just five years later in1941 the Allied powers defeated the Italian forces in EastAfrica and all the Somali territories, including the Ogaden, werebriefly united under a single British military administration.Following World War II, theAllied powers established the Four Power Commission (Britain,United States, Soviet Union,and France) to decide the fate of defeated Italy's colonial possessions.Divergent claims were presented to the Commission, which was itself deeplydivided. Italy wanted itscolonial possessions returned; Ethiopiawanted control over the Ogaden territory; while Britainsupported a united Somaliaunder British colonial administration. Somali clans were also divided, withsome petitioning to remain with Ethiopiaand others advocating for a "Greater Somalia."[6]In the end, Britainrestored Ethiopian sovereignty over the Ogaden territory and abandoned itsvision of one united Somali state administered by Britain. On September 23, 1948, the Ogaden wastransferred from British to Ethiopian control, with little incident, but overthe strenuous objections of Somali nationalists.[7]The additional territories of the "Reserved Areas," which are largely inhabitedby non-Ogaadeeni Somali clans, were handed over to Ethiopian control in 1948and 1954.The Role of Somaliaand Insurgency Movements in the 1960s and 1970sSomali nationalism gained significant momentum with theestablishment of an independent Somaliain 1960. The new Somali constitution called for the "union of Somaliterritories" and the Somali flag featured a five-pointed star against a UN-bluebackground, each point of the star symbolizing one of the five Somali regions.[8]Somalia'snew government swiftly started a diplomatic and military campaign to unite thethree "missing" regions to the new Somali state. The latter effort includedsupporting Somali insurgent groups in southeastern Ethiopia, the beginning of a strategyof cross-border insurgency support on both sides of the Ethiopian-Somali borderthat was to endure for decades.[9]The first insurgent activities began in the early 1960s,supported by the Somali government. Activities escalated in 1963 to include attackson police stations and convoys.[10]This, alongside rising Oromo nationalism, provoked an Ethiopian militarycrackdown on southeastern Ethiopiaand a series of clashes with the Somali military.[11]Under Emperor Haile Selassie, the Ethiopian military employed abusivecounter-insurgency tactics to deal with the problem of Somali "agitation" inthe east. Many of these tactics, including the confiscation or destruction oflarge numbers of livestock to put pressure on Somali pastoralists andcontrolling water points,[12]have been replicated by successive administrations.The Somali-backed insurgency in Ogaden and neighboring Oromoterritories caused Ethiopiato declare martial law in parts of the region in 1966. It took Ethiopiauntil 1971 to pacify the region through a combination of military campaigns andthe careful cultivation of pro-Ethiopian Ogaadeeni and Oromo figures.[13]The 1969 military coup of Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre in Somalia also focused Somaliaon domestic priorities, leading to diminished support for the insurgent groupspreviously supported by Somalia.[14]The Somali-Ethiopian War over the Ogaden, 1977-78In 1974 the political landscape changed dramatically whenEmperor Haile Selassie was deposed by Mengistu Haile Mariam, who establishedthe "Derg" (literally "committee" in Amharic) military rule. This developmentcoincided with increasing efforts by Somalia's President Siad Barre tobolster his regime. Siad Barre's deals with some clan elders resulted in the1976 establishment of the Western Somalia Liberation Front (WSLF). Based in Mogadishu and Hargeysa,the WSLF was able to recruit disgruntled Ogaadeeni pastoralists who hadsuffered from the Ethiopian military campaigns and the famine of 1974-5.[15]Somaliaincreased its support for the rebel groups fighting in the Ogaden but theirguerrilla raids made less headway than the Somali army wanted. In early 1977President Barre began sending in soldiers from the Somali regular army with therebels, without uniform or heavy weaponry.[16] InJuly 1977 the Somali army scaled up its campaign and launched a full-scaleinvasion, taking control of Jijiga and much of the southern Ogaden in September1977.[17]But Barre's invasion of Ethiopiasoon led to a Soviet (and Cuban) military intervention on behalf of Ethiopia, and by early 1978 Somalia had suffered a devastatingmilitary defeat.[18]Many of the worst abuses against civilians occurred after the Ethiopianvictory, during the reoccupation by Ethiopian forces. Up to 500,000 people wereinternally displaced, and thousands of ethnic Somalis fled with the retreatingSomali army into Somalia.[19]The Ethiopian-Somali war and Mengistu's military victory hadsignificant consequences in the region, setting the stage for Somalia's fragmentation and theeventual ouster of Somali President Siad Barre more than a decade later.[20]  In the interim there were years of insurgencyand counter-insurgency operations.Mengistu's "Secret Wars" in SoutheastEthiopia, 1978-84Although riven by internal divisions, Ogaadeeni and Oromo insurgenciescontinued their operations in southeast Ethiopia, sometimes from bases onSomali soil.[21]By early 1979, the insurgents controlled a substantial part of the countryside.[22]Africa Watch (the precursor to Human Rights Watch's AfricaDivision) analyzed Ethiopian counter-insurgency operations in this period andfound that they followed a four-pronged approach: i) the forced displacement ofmuch of the civilian population into shelters and protected villages; ii)military offensives against people and economic assets outside the shelters;iii) the sponsoring of insurgent groups against the WSLF and Somali government;and iv) attempts to promote the repatriation of refugees.[23] InDecember 1979, a new Ethiopian military offensive, this time including Sovietadvisors and Cuban troops, "was more specifically directed against thepopulation's means of survival, including poisoning and bombing waterholes andmachine gunning herds of cattle."[24]Militarily, the counter-insurgency operations succeeded in greatly weakeningthe insurgents or driving them across the border into Somalia.[25]Abuses connected to the counter-insurgency operations in theOgaden, Harerghe, and neighboring Oromo areas of Sidamo and Bale from 1978(when the "official war" with Somaliaended) until 1984 generated several million displaced people. Human RightsWatch concluded in 1991:[T]the great majority of the war affected population ofsoutheast Ethiopiafrom late 1979 onwards was affected not by the fighting between the Somali andEthiopian armies in 1977/8, but by the counter-insurgency strategy of theEthiopian government which was implemented from December 1979 onwards. Many ofthe people were affected by the military operations of the army,others were affected by the forced relocations.[26]The policy of forced relocation affected more than twomillion people. The forced relocations, other abuses, and restrictions onmovement posed by the ongoing military activities combined with drought in 1984to worsen what was already chronic famine in the region.[27]Another key development in the region in the early 1980s wasthe formation of the Somali National Movement (SNM), which drew support fromthe Isaaq clan in northern Somalia.The SNM obtained support from Mengistu's government to fight Siad Barre and theWSLF, a deliberate strategy of divide and rule shared by both the Somali andEthiopian governments, which further fragmented communities along clan lines.[28]The 1991 Overthrow of Mengistu and the Collapse of SomaliaIn 1984 the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) split anda breakaway group called the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) wasformed.[29]Meanwhile, across the border in northern Somalia,the Ethiopian-backed SNM increased activities against the Somali government,which responded by arming Ethiopian Somali and Oromo refugees in the camps in Somalia.[30]By 1988 Mengistu's government was under pressure fromEthiopian insurgent groups, particularly the Tigray Popular Liberation Front(TPLF) and its then-ally, the Eritrean Popular Liberation Front (EPLF). InApril 1988 Mengistu signed a peace agreement with Siad Barre in which bothcountries pledged to end support to cross-border insurgent groups.Neither government fully implemented thepledge andEthiopiasoon began supporting other Somali insurgent movements in southern Somalia.[31]However, Ethiopia'sthreatened expulsion of the SNM provoked an escalation of fighting in northern Somalia that soon led to full-scale civil war,provoked a reverse influx of Ethiopian returnees and Somali refugees intoeastern Ethiopia,and was the beginning of the end of the Siad Barre government.[32]In January 1991 the Somali government collapsed.In May 1991 the TPLF led by Meles Zenawi,[33]Ethiopia's current primeminister, succeeded in taking control of AddisAbaba and ousting Mengistu's repressive Derggovernment. The TPLF headed a coalition of political opposition groups calledthe Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The TPLF gainedsupport by including within the EPRDF groups claiming to represent differentregions and ethnicities. It also established a federal administrative structurebased on ethnic and linguistic distinctions, a model commonly known as "ethnicfederalism."Ethnic Federalism and the Somali Region under the EPRDFEthnic federalism promised, for the first time in Ethiopia'slong history, to respect the country's cultural diversity and give meaningfulautonomy to its different ethnic groups. For Ethiopian Somalis, it was thefirst time that they were officially recognized as one of the country's peoplesrather than as on the periphery of the Ethiopian political, cultural, andsocial center. This new stake in the national Ethiopian identity was bolsteredby the collapse of the Somali state and the failure of Somali irredentistefforts in the 20th century.[34]By 1992 Somali Region became one of nine ethnic regions of Ethiopiadelegated regional autonomy with its own president and Parliament.[35]That year the first regional elections took place, contested by a number ofclan-based, politically inexperienced, and disorganized political parties inwhat was nonetheless an unprecedented display of multi-party politics.[36]Although the ONLF was not a member of the EPRDF coalition or an ally of theTPLF,[37]it won 60 percent of regional parliamentary seats and formed the newgovernment.[38]As the ONLF continued to assert its demands forself-determination for the Ogaden, its relations with the EPRDF soured. TheONLF's Ogaadeeni clan perspective also alarmed members of other Somali clans,and disagreements over the name of the region ("Ogaden" or "Somali Region") andthe location of the regional capital were the basis of early parliamentarydisputes.[39]There was little political experience or administrativeexpertise within the new regional government. Divisions among the clans, andconcerns over the ONLF's functioning were compounded by mismanagement andallegations of corruption and by mid-1993 the regional executive council andpresident were replaced.[40]The Ethiopian government responded by attempting to limitthe support base of the ONLF by throwing its support behind non-Ogaadeeni clansand politicians such as the minister for economic and international relations,Abdulmajid Hussein, an Isaaq clan member and former Ethiopian representative tothe UN. For the ONLF and many Ogaadeeni clan members, the efforts of thecentral government to undermine the ONLF's support base were seen asunwarranted central interference in their regional affairs and politicalissues.In February 1994 the ONLF-dominated regional assemblytriggered a confrontation with the central EPRDF government by voting toexercise the "right to self-determination" for Somali Region.[41]The federal government moved swiftly, removing the second regional president, HassanJire Qalinle, and his deputy from their posts on charges of corruption andneglect of official duties (charges that were to be frequently used to replaceSomali officials in later years). Most of the regional administration wasreplaced later that year and a new EPRDF affiliate party, the Ethiopian SomaliDemocratic League (ESDL), was formed by 10 non-Ogaadeeni political parties,with Abdulmajid Hussein as its president.[42]Although the ESDL was supported by the EPRDF, it alsobenefited from substantial support from non-Ogaadeeni clans alarmed by theONLF's Ogaadeeni dominance and agenda.[43] Inthe 1995 national and regional elections, the ESDL won a strong majority in theregional parliament (76 of 139 seats). It also won 15 of 23 seats allotted toSomali Region in the federal assembly.[44]The ESDL governed the region for almost four years, longerthan any of its predecessors, but was also plagued by internal divisions andeventually lost credibility among the population, which perceived it as anEPRDF instrument due to the repeated federal interference in regional affairs.In 1998, a new party, the Somali People's Democratic Party (SPDP), was formedfrom a merger of ESDL and a splinter group of ONLF.[45]This party too has suffered from the widespread popular perception that it isan EPRDF puppet and has also been wracked by charges of corruption andincompetence.[46]Implementing Federal Policy: Structures of ControlThe government has retained theadministrative structures established under Mengistu's Derg government toensure tight control over the population. Ethiopia is divided into ethnicregions which are further divided into zones, weredas (districts) and kebele(village or neighborhoods). The latter two are the primary units ofadministrative control and they exert enormous power over the daily lives ofordinary Ethiopians.[47]In Somali Region, this system of social control is enhancedby security committees, called timmir committees, which exist atevery administrative level-region, zone, wereda,and kebele. At the wereda, zone, and regional levels, the committeesusually include members of the armed forces, military intelligence, security,administration officials from the zone or wereda respectively, andrepresentatives of the SPDP.[48]The security services exertintensive scrutiny and create a pervasive sense of intimidation through theseadministrative structures, many of which are dominated by regional partymembers. For example, the committees concern themselves with every detail ofpeoples' lives. One eyewitness described to Human Rights Watch the military'squestioning of a 60-year-old man about an elderly relative visiting him. Hesaid that they were questioning the man about the woman, "She is 70 years old,[and they were] asking for information about her son….That is the level ofintimidation. They knew about her-you have to register your guests with thekebele."[49]Another way the federal government seeks to keep closecontrol is through the presence of a number of federal advisors. These individualswork closely with certain regional officials, such as Abdi Mohammed Omar (alsoknown as Abdi Illey), the regional head of security, and often becomeinformally implicated in regional politics.Although regional government officials, such as the regionalpresident, theoretically exert significant power, most observers view thefederal-regional dynamics as riven with factions and competition, with theregional president himself dependent on personal alliances and ever-fearful ofpowerful federal officials such as Abbay Teshaye, who is informally viewed asthe top federal policymaker in Somali Region.[50] Therapidly shifting alliances were amply illustrated by the December 2007detention of Ibrahim Haad, the businessman previously perceived by many Somalisto be a powerful figure with close links to the government, whose farm wasattacked by the ONLF in April 2007.The repeated removal of regional presidents and thecontinuing presence of powerful TPLF/EPRDF "technical advisors" in the regionhave reinforced the view of many Ethiopian Somalis that the regionaladministration has little real power and that the autonomy promised by ethnicfederalism has been a hollow pledge. This perception is exacerbated by theEPRDF policy of appointing a parallel system of government-paid elders called amakari (advisor in Amharic) at eachadministrative level. This policy is viewed by some as proof of thegovernment's intent to extend its authority over communities at everyopportunity in the interest of maintaining security.[51]Military forces are, of course, another key part of thefederal government's security arsenal. Although there is little informationavailable about the number and type of troops in the area, the EthiopianNational Defense Forces (ENDF) maintain a heavypresence. Well before the 2007 escalation in the conflict (see below), therewere at least two ENDF kifletor (army divisions) present in SomaliRegion.[52]According to a former member of the armed forces, in 2005, Division 12 wasbased in Jijiga and Division 14 in Kabridahar. More recently, sources toldHuman Rights Watch that at various times Divisions 11, 12, 13, 14, and 32 weredeployed in the region.[53]Each division has four brigades of about 2,000 men each, which are stationed inmajor towns or weredas. Each brigade consists of two battalions of 1,000 troopscommanded by a shaleka (Amharicfor commander of 1,000). The bulk of the troops are from elsewhere in Ethiopia,such as Oromia and Amhara states, and do not speak Somali.The increasing presence of federal security forces in SomaliRegion has done little to increase the legitimacy of the regionaladministration or ease tensions with the federal government. Although someEthiopian Somalis support military presence in the region as a means of containingthe ongoing conflict in neighboring Somalia, many people, includingEthiopian Somalis who do not necessarily support the ONLF, view the federalsecurity forces as "TPLF military" and the latest manifestation of a longhistory of security-dominated central policy towards the region.[54]The conduct of the ENDF operating in Somali Region since theearly 1990s has been regularly punctuated by allegations of serious humanrights abuses such as arbitrary arrest and detention, extrajudicial killings,and enforced disappearances, including of regional government officials.[55]RenewedInsurgency and Conflict in Somali RegionThe agendas, leadership, interconnections, and sources ofsupport received by the various armed groups operating in Somali Region are oftenunclear. However they can be distinguished in two significant ways: whetherthey are Ogaadeeni or Somali nationalists, and whether there is a militantIslamist component to their agenda. The aims and tactics of the various groupsare diverse.The major armed group currentlyfighting the Ethiopian government in Somali Region is the ONLF. Although itoften claims to represent Ethiopian Somalis across clan lines, the ONLF remainsessentially an Ogaadeeni sub-clan-based insurgency, operating largely in thezones inhabited by the Rer Abdalle sub-clan of the Mohammed Zubeir. ManyEthiopian Somalis concerned by the historical marginalization of Somali Regionby successive Ethiopian governments and the role of the Ethiopian securityforces do not necessarily support the ONLF. Even among Ogaadeeni sub-clansthere is varying support for the group and diverse views on the ONLF's role,strategy, and tactics.[56]The Ogaadeeni clan's relations with other clans in SomaliRegion are further complicated by competition over resources, a cause offriction that has become worse in recent years due to increasing cycles ofdrought, environmental degradation, and the increasing number of pastoralistsshifting to agro-pastoralism.[57]In the past decade there have been serious inter-clan clashes over territoryand political competition that have displaced thousands of people.[58]The ONLF's current goals are murky. Although ONLF statementsseem to espouse Ogaadeeni-rather than Somali-self-determination, for instanceby referring to or calling for "Ogadenia," it is unclear whether the ONLF seekssecession from the Ethiopian state or simply greater regional autonomy. Inreality, the ONLF primarily thrives on anti-Ethiopian sentiments and grievancesmore than any stated policy objective.The ONLF operates as a rurally-based guerilla forceconsisting mostly of small units (20-30 fighters) assigned to different zones.Its units, domestically called "anti-peace elements" by the Ethiopiangovernment, are constantly on the move. ONLF fighters regularly interact withcivilians, particularly pastoralists in the area frequented by the ONLF, andobtain food and water in the countryside and from a network of civiliansupporters in the towns and villages.Little is known about the precise agenda and size of asecond armed opposition group, the United Western Somali Liberation Front(UWSLF), which surfaced in 2006 and briefly took two aid workers hostage.[59]However, their public statements suggest an Islamist and Somali nationalistagenda,[60]in contrast to the essentially Ogaadeeni clan-based agenda of the ONLF.[61]  The UWSLF may draw support from the remnantsof the militant Islamist group known as al-Itihaad al-Islaami ee SoomaaliyaGalbeed (the Islamic Union of Western Somalia), which began to operate in theSomali Region by 1991.[62]An Ethiopian military offensive in 1996 reportedly destroyed most ofal-Itihaad's military capacity in both eastern Ethiopiaand southwestern Somalia.[63]Al-Itihaad claimed responsibility for several grenade attacks and bombings in1995 and 1996, including in AddisAbaba, which killed and wounded dozens of people.[64]After September 11, 2001,al-Itihaad was placed on a USlist of organizations and individuals designated for asset freezes due toterrorist links.[65]The Somalia and Eritrea ConnectionsIn 2006 the situation in Somali Region was exacerbated onceagain by events in neighboring Somalia.In June 2006 an alliance of Islamic courts (Islamic Courts Union, ICU) drovethe Somali warlords out of Mogadishu,where they had ruled under a reign of violence. Led by Sheikh Aweys ofal-Itihaad, the ICU's ascendance stoked fears in both AddisAbaba and Washingtonof spreading Islamist extremism and revived militant Somali nationalism. Thepresence in Mogadishu of individuals with allegedlinks to al Qaeda and the 1998 East Africaembassy bombings did little to quell rising concern. With border tensions with Eritrea still unresolved, Ethiopia was further provoked byallegations of Eritrean support to the ICU, the ONLF, and other Ethiopianinsurgent movements.[66]In December 2006, following the passage of UN SecurityCouncil resolution 1725 authorizing an African Union intervention in Somalia,Ethiopian forces backed the weak Somali Transitional Federal Government in anoffensive to oust the ICU and establish the TFG in power in Mogadishu. Whilethe Ethiopian and TFG forces were initially successful in overthrowing the ICU,a coalition of insurgent groups soon started to launch attacks on the Ethiopianforces and the TFG in Somalia.[67]Since the December 2006 ouster of the Islamic Courts Union from Mogadishu, the al-Shabaabmilitary wing of the Islamic Courts is reported to have tried to establish apresence in Somali Region.The relations between the ONLF and militant Islamist groupssuch as al-Itihaad and al-Shabaab are unclear. Although the Ethiopiangovernment routinely claims they are connected, there are credible reports thatthe ONLF and al-Shabaab clashed in Somali Region in late 2007. The ONLF hasrepeatedly sought to distance itself from some of the more militant Islamistgroups operating in the region, particularly in the context of growing US andEthiopian concerns over individuals and groups with alleged links to al Qaedaoperating in neighboring Somalia.[68]What is established, however, is that many of thesegroups-and other Ethiopian insurgent groups such as the Oromo Liberation front(OLF)-have received support from Ethiopia's arch rival, Eritrea. Both the ONLFand OLF established a presence in Eritrea during the Ethiopian-Eritreanwar of 1998-2000, and received training as well as logistical and militarysupport. Eritrea continuesto host the leaders of both insurgent movements and leaders of the IslamicCourts Union in Somalia, andthe ONLF and OLF also had a presence in Mogadishuin 2006. The Eritrean factor and concerns over its support to the variousEthiopian insurgent groups were one of the key underlying reasons for Ethiopia's intervention in Somalia in support of the Somalitransitional government in 2006.[69]Escalation in 2007It is no coincidence that Ethiopia'sintervention in Somaliacoincided with a serious escalation in the conflict in Somali Region. Beginningin early 2007, the ONLF increased its targeting of representatives of theregional and local administrations in Somali Region, as well as militaryconvoys. In January 2007 ONLF rebels attacked Garbo wereda in Fiiq zone, killing five local officials who refused to hand overheavy weapons to the rebels. A week later, the ONLF attacked Gunagada policestation in Dhagahbur zone. Twenty-five people were killed in the attack,including the local head of security, Sa'ad Aw Siyad. The ONLF also abducted anumber of officials, including the police commissioner, Bedel Abdi Nor, who according to released detainees was later executed.Although the ENDF had already increased its presence in theconflict-affected zones of Somali Region following the ONLF's January 2007attacks, the April 2007 attack on the Chinese-run Obole oil installation[70]and a May 2007 grenade attack on the regional president, Abdullahi Hassan, inSomali Region's capital, Jijiga, which killed five people and injured dozensincluding Hassan, provoked an escalated response.[71] TheObole attack came just as Ethiopian forces in Mogadishu were involved in fierce fightingwith Somali insurgents.According to credible sources, after the Obole attack seniorregional and security officials met in Jijiga. Those present included PrimeMinister Meles' senior advisor on security, Abbay Tsehaye, and army chief ofstaff General "Samora" Yunes, as well as the military commander from Harar.They are reported to have identified the most important sources of ONLF supportas: a) rural villagers and communities; b) commercial traffic of khat (a mild narcotic grown in the area)and other trade items; c) humanitarian aid; d) and local businessmen.[72]The abuses uncovered by Human RightsWatch appear directly or indirectly connected to measures targeting each ofthese alleged sources of support.Prime Minister Meles Zenawi announced on June 9, 2007, that theEthiopian government had commenced a large-scale counteroffensive to suppressthe ONLF rebellion, and brought large numbers of military reinforcements intothe region.[73]From June to September 2007, the counterinsurgency campaignappears to have been at its peak. This period was characterized by systematicand intensive efforts by Ethiopian forces to relocate, terrorize, and punishcommunities in areas of ONLF operation or perceived to support the insurgency,using various abusive strategies.From September 2007 the Ethiopian government's strategy appearsto have shifted from the direct use of military forces to increased forcedrecruitment and deployment of local militia forces. The almost totalobstruction of humanitarian aid that was implemented in mid-2007 was slightlyrelaxed, perhaps due to growing international pressure, although humanitarianoperations remained tightly controlled.Reports of village burnings and relocations have diminishedin 2008. This may reflect a change of strategy on the part of the Ethiopianmilitary and fewer clashes with the ONLF, or may be the simple result of thousandsof people having now fled the region. However, concerns over many of the otherpatterns of abuses documented in this report, such as arbitrary detention,torture, rape, and mistreatment in custody remain as intense as ever.Part 2: Violations by the Ethiopian GovernmentThe government's counter-insurgency response involves amulti-pronged approach aimed at cutting off economic resources, weakening theONLF's civilian support base, and confining its geographic area of operation.To achieve these aims the Ethiopian armed forces have committed numerousviolations of human rights, violations of the laws of war that amount to warcrimes, and crimes against humanity against the civilian population. These haveincluded widespread forced relocations of civilians, destruction of theirvillages, willful killings, and summary executions, and torture, rape, andother forms of sexual violence.Some of the current government's counter-insurgencystrategies-such as attempting to constrict rural civilian movement and assetsand using brutal force to terrorize civilian populations-have a long history ofuse by previous governments. However, the EPRDF government has also introducednew methods, such as forced recruitment of local militia and the manipulationof clan dynamics.The pattern of abuses by government forces in 2007, althoughintensified, is unfortunately not new. In the course of conducting the researchfor this report, eyewitnesses to atrocities frequently told Human Rights Watchresearchers about previous incidents of village burnings, summary executions,rape, and torture at the hands of security forces, some dating back a decade.Forced Displacement and Destruction of VillagesIn an attempt to cut offcivilian support to the ONLF and concentrate its rural support base indesignated larger villages and towns, Ethiopia's scaled up counterinsurgencycampaign against the ONLF has involved widespread forced displacement,particularly between June and August 2007. The government has ordered civiliansto relocate from small villages and pastoralist settlements to designated townsthroughout the conflict-affected zones, typically ordering the villagers andnomads to move within two to seven days. To secure compliance with theevacuation orders, the Ethiopian army repeatedly implemented a phased system ofterror involving the confiscation and killing of livestock, public executions,and the destruction of villages by burning.Villagers and pastoralists who refuse to evacuate have beenkilled, and many villages and nomadic settlements have been burned by the army,while water sources and wells have been destroyed. Evacuated villages andsettlements become no-go areas: civilians who remain behind risk being shot onsight, tortured, or raped if spotted by soldiers. Human Rights Watch receivedreports of 87 villages and nomadic settlements that were partially or totallyburned and/or forcefully evacuated during government military operationsbetween June 2006 and August 2007, but the actual number of such burned orevacuated villages is likely to be much higher, even within that time period.International humanitarian law prohibits the forced transferof the civilian population during a conflict unless specifically for thesecurity of the civilian population or because it is required for imperativemilitary reasons.[74]Relocating civilians to prevent them from assisting insurgent forces or topunish them for doing so is prohibited. The destruction of civilian property isalso unlawful.[75]The Ethiopian government's forced relocation ofthousands of civilians in conflict-affected areas of Somali Region amounts tothe unlawful transfer of the population and collective punishment of Ogaadeenicommunities perceived to be supporting the ONLF. Individuals who ordered orcarried out such acts intentionally or recklessly are responsible for warcrimes.Cases of Forced Evacuation, Killings, and Village BurningsThe cases documented below are in general based on multipleeyewitness interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch, and offer detailedaccounts of incidents in particular villages. These case studies reflect apattern of Ethiopian army abuses that have taken place across theconflict-affected region, but this is by no means a comprehensive list. Thescale of village burnings, killings, and other abuses is believed to besignificantly larger than the number of cases described below.The patterns of such attacks are strikingly similar: theEthiopian military first issues orders to the villagers to evacuate thevillages within two to seven days. When the villagers refuse to evacuate, thearmy returns to carry out killings and other atrocities, and burns the village.Should soldiers see villagers or pastoralists in the area after the evacuationand burning of the village, they are often beaten and detained, summarilyexecuted or, if women or girls, raped.For example, in late May and early June 2007, the Ethiopianarmed forces and regional authorities removed much of the rural population ofWardheer wereda, in Wardheer zone, and some villages in neighboring weredas inKorahe zone towards Wardheer town and other sites including Walwal, Danood, andQoriley. They evacuated more than a dozen villages in an approximately60-kilometer radius of Wardheer town alone during this operation, includingDaratoole, Lahelow, Neef-Kuceliye, Qamuuda, Dhurwaa-Hararaf, Ubatale, Wa'do,Aado (Caado), Arowela, Yu'ub (Yucub), and Laanjalelo. The majority of thesevillages were burned after their forced evacuation. Similar operations offorced relocation and occasional burnings of villages have taken place aroundother major towns, such as Garbo, Sagag, Dhagahbur, and Shilabo.In addition to information from eyewitnesses, Human RightsWatch received numerous accounts from people who were not present at the timeof the alleged burnings but saw the villages afterwards while traveling throughthe region. Sometimes their accounts could not be corroborated by other witnesstestimony. However, satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch hasconfirmed that some of the villages mentioned by these individuals did showsigns of significant destruction and removal of structures and indications ofburning.For example, in October 2007 a 35-year-old refugee in Kenyatold Human Rights Watch researchers that when he was fleeing the attacks aroundWardheer in July 2007, he observed that Dameerey village, located betweenWardheer and Aware towns, was burned. Human Rights Watch was unable tocorroborate this claim with other eyewitness accounts, but "before" and "after"satellite images acquired in December 2006 and March 2008 confirm a significantremoval of structures and signs of burning in Dameerey village.Click to expand ImageDameerey- December 23, 2006 (Lat: 7.548; Long: 44.978) © 2008 DigitalGlobe.-Dameerey- March 7, 2008: Structures comprising almost theentire town (about 65 structures) were removed, possibly burned, since thecollection of the previous image. © 2008 DigitalGlobe.In another example, several refugees from Shilabo weredaclaimed that Lasoole village (near Shilabo town, in Korahe zone) was burned inJune or July 2007, but were not eyewitnesses to the events. Satellite imagery laterconfirmed their allegations.Click to expand ImageLaasoole- March 30, 2005 (Lat:6.233; Long: 44.754) ©2008 DigitalGlobe.-Laasoole-July 17, 2007: About 76 structures, most of the town, were likely removed ordamaged since the collection of the previous image, and burning is likely onthe roadway. Note that multiple new structures (not shown) also appeared inthis area since the collection of the first image. © 2008 DigitalGlobe.Ela-Obo,February 2007In February 2007, government forces came to the nomadicsettlement of Ela-Obo, a watering point in the Fiiq wereda of Fiiq zone, andordered the civilian population to relocate to nearby Galalshe village.According to an eyewitness, an army commander gathered the population and toldthem, "The government has decided to move people into one bigger place. You areordered to leave here and move to Galalshe. If you don't move to Galalshe,we'll remove you ourselves."[76]When some of the villagers tried to argue with the officer,saying they didn't want to leave their homes, the commander ordered the arrestof six camel herders, and the rounding up of the camels. In front of thegathered villagers, the commander then ordered the six men executed, and thecamels shot. Five men were shot dead: Deq Yusuf Lacag, Hassan AbdurrahmanMuhumed Omar, Haji Abdi Ibraahim, Khadar Keenadiid, and Waajir Sheikh Osman,while a sixth survived. Some 20 camels were also killed. After the soldiersleft, the survivor was taken away by his relatives and brought to a neighboringvillage.Four days later soldiers returned to Ela-Obo after receivinginformation that there had been a survivor of the execution. They detained andsummarily executed two female and two male relatives of the survivor: ArdoMuhumed Mohamoud, 18, Hodan Muhumed Mohamoud, 20, Abdullahi Hussein Abdi, andMuhumed Hassan.[77]  Following the second deadly incident, mostvillagers fled.In late February, a few weeks after the initial killings,soldiers followed suspected ONLF tracks into Ela-Obo. After the remainingvillagers again refused to leave the area, the soldiers summarily executedanother nine herders: Ahmed Nur Hussein Mataan, Abdi Aden Ahmed, Nasir OsmanAden, Mohamed Abdi Saahid, Nur Ayaanle Sheikh Mohamed Ali, Mohamed-gurey AliTaraar, Mohamed Beddel Gaas, and two brothers from the Bashir Mukhtar family.All nine were buried in the nearby settlement of Malqaqa. Seven other mendetained that day remain missing and are feared dead.[78]Wardheer and Shilabo weredas, May/June 2007In late May and early June 2007, the armed forces andEthiopian regional authorities began to forcibly displace the rural populationfrom villages in Wardheer and neighboring weredas towards Wardheer town andother designated locations. Many villages in a 60-kilometer radius of Wardheerwere affected including Daratoole, Lahelow, Neef-Kuceliye, Qamuuda,Dhurwaa-Hararaf, Ubatale, Wa'di, Aado (Caado), Arowela, Yu'ub (Yucub), andLaanjalelo. Villagers were ordered to evacuate their villages and were warnedthat failure to obey the orders would lead to the burning of their villages. Anelder in Wa'di (Wacdi), a village north of Wardheer town, told Human RightsWatch that on June 15, 2007,Ethiopian officials came to Wa'di and ordered the civilians to leave thevillage, warning that if they refused the order, their village would be burned.Over the next weeks, many of the villages in the vicinity ofWardheer town were partially or totally burned: Daratoole was burned inmid-June; Qamuuda (in neighboring Shilabo wereda, Korahe zone) was burned onJune 21; Neef-Kuceliye on June 23; Wa'di, Laanjalelo, Aado, and Jinnoole wereburned in mid-July.[79]Many additional villages and nomadic settlements in theWardheer wereda were emptied of their population, either on orders of thegovernment or because the residents feared attacks.Some of the burnings may have been in reprisal for ONLFactivity in the area. A person present in Qamuuda when it was burned by thearmy described the attack to Human Rights Watch, and explained that ONLFfighters had passed through the village just the evening before:When Qamuuda was burned, I was there. It is about 30houses. It was alleged ONLF visited the village. They entered on that morningand burned around 8 a.m. andleft around 3 p.m. Theyused fuel they found in the village to burn by setting fire. I saw ONLF inQamuuda several times. They were carrying guns, came out of the bush. WhenQamuuda was burned, the ONLF came there just before the burning.[80]Satellite images confirmed thedestruction of Qamuuda.Click to expand ImageQamuuda- December 23, 2006 (Lat: 6.543; Long: 44.903) ©2008 DigitalGlobe.-Qamuuda- March 24, 2008: About 85 structures were likelyremoved or damaged when compared with the previous image. © 2008 DigitalGlobe.About a week after the burning of Qamuuda, government soldiersentered the nearby villageof Jaleelo, also inShilabo wereda, apparently following the tracks of suspected ONLF fightersoperating in the area. A witness told Human Rights Watch that the soldiersstayed in the village for two days, slaughtering and eating some of the goatsof the villagers. During their time in the village, the soldiers shot dead twounidentified young men who approached the village and then tried to run awaywhen they saw the soldiers. After two days, the soldiers told the villagers toleave Jaleelo, and burned the homes in the village before departing.[81]Labiga and FaafanValley,June 2007Among the worst killings of civilians by the Ethiopian armywere those that occurred during an army operation in the FaafanValleyin June 2007. Soldiers allegedly willfully shot and killed at least 25civilians, including men, women, and children. The FaafanValleyand the Gohdi basin are located southwest of Dhagahbur town in Dhagahbur zone,and are an ONLF stronghold.[82]In mid-June 2007, pro-government militias known as tadaaqi came to the Gohdi basinsurrounding Labiga town, and began ordering nomads and residents of the smallersettlements to move immediately to Labiga town. When the villagers refused tomove, the tadaaqi began rounding up and confiscating the villagers' camels.According to an eyewitness:Initially, the [tadaaqi]told the villagers from the area to move to Labiga. The villagers refused.Labiga is located in a long valley know as Gohdi, and there are 14 smallvillages in this valley. All the people from these villages were ordered torelocate to Labiga, which lies on the main road. When the villagers refused,the [tadaaqi] came and confiscatedtheir camels. The [tadaaqi] washolding the camels in an enclosure near Koracelis. They gathered hundreds ofcamels confiscated from the villages along the valley over several days.[83]Following the confiscation of the camels, the camel ownerssent a delegation of elders to meet with the tadaaqi to try and get the camels released, but the tadaaqi refused the request. The camelswere kept in eight traditional xeroenclosures (each xero can hold up to200 camels) in Koracelis town. After failing to negotiate the release of thecamels, the camel owners decided to attack the tadaaqi camp and get their camels released by force, according totwo eyewitnesses interviewed separately by Human Rights Watch: "The owners ofthe camels organized themselves, took their weapons, and attacked the [tadaaqi] camp to release the camels."[84]During the attack on the tadaaqicamp to free the camels, at least four armed camel owners (Wayel Abdi Iman,Asad Yusuf Iley, Mohammed Abdi Yare, and Miyir), two local residents, and anunknown number of tadaaqi militiamembers were killed.[85]Following the attack by the armed camel owners on the tadaaqi camp and the freeing of theircamels, the Ethiopian army deployed a large force to the area, burning down thevillages and willfully killing at least 20 civilians. A woman living in Diyaarvillage at the time it was attacked told Human Rights Watch that the soldiersshot dead her husband, Mohammed Abade Hassan, 30, and her father-in-law, AbadeHassan Omar, 70, during the attack:The soldiers arrived from all corners. They went into everyvillage and set it on fire, and they were shooting as they burned them. Theystarted burning Diyaar, Hunjurri, Koracelis, Labiga, and Gohdi. It was early inthe morning.There are lots of farms around the area. We owned a farm.My husband was killed that morning, around 5:30 a.m. He was hit by the bullet in front of the house.We were new to the area, I was only there for 13 dayswhen the attack happened. My children were staying with their grandmother wholived in the same area and they fled with them. My husband's father was alsokilled in that morning after he was shot. I also saw the bodies of others.[86]A second eyewitness from Diyaar, a 28-year-old man, washimself shot in the shoulder by the soldiers as he stood in the doorway of hishome. Soldiers shot and killed his wife Fadumo Ibrahim, 28, and two young children,Abdinasir Mohammed Farah, 1, and Halima Mohammed Abdi, 2. He told Human RightsWatch:When the fighting happened around Labiga, I was in Diyaar.[The army] launched a [military] operation around 2:30 a.m. The people in the villages confronted them. Thesoldiers shot me in front of my house. My wife and two children died ten metersaway from me. She died in the shooting along with my two children. The bullethit me in the shoulder and they left me for dead.[87]At least six other civilians were shot dead during the armyattacks on Diyaar and Koracelis, including Sharaf Moallim Abdi Dagaal, 35, andher two children aged 2 and 3; Mohammed Abdi Qara-yar, 63, and Hassan MataanMoallim Abdi, 25.[88]Satellite images of Labiga confirm accounts of burning anddestruction.Click to expand ImageLabiga- September 26, 2005 (Lat:8.118; Long: 43.391) © 2008 DigitalGlobe.-Labiga- February 28, 2008: Almost the entire town (about 40structures) was likely removed or damaged subsequent to the collection of the previousimage, and the grey/white areas are possible evidence of burning. © 2008 DigitalGlobe.Another 12 civilians were killed around Labiga and Hunjurrivillages, according to other eyewitnesses. During the first army raid, soldiersreportedly shot nine civilians in Labiga and Hunjurri, most of them in theirfarms, their homes, or while trying to run away from the army: Muhumed YusufOmar, 23, his brother Muhuyadin Yusuf Omar, 21, and their brother-in-law AhmedAbdullahi Adan, 41; Abdullahi Muhumed Mataan, 61; Sheikh Mohammed Hassan Wahar,65; Farhan Ali Shide, 13; Abdullahi Ahmed Af-da'un, 14; Qorgab Ali Abshir, 19;and Moallim Ahmed Mohammed Hashi, 30, a Koranic school teacher. Three dayslater, soldiers returned to Labiga and killed another three civilians as theyattempted to return to their homes: Sheikh Ahmed; and Yusuf Abdi "Adhi-fool"and his young daughter.[89]Lahelow, June 2007In June 2007, the military commander of Wardheer came to Lahelow,a nomadic settlement of some 1,000 families located southwest of Wardheer town,near the boundary between Wardheer and Korahe zones, and ordered the populationto gather for a meeting. He informed the population that the government orderedthem to leave the area within seven days and relocate to Wardheer town. Sincemost of the population of Lahelow consisted of pastoralists who needed grazingland for their livestock, many residents refused to relocate.When the seven-day deadline expired, a military force ofsome 200 soldiers returned and detained five civilians: Mohammed Abdi Wayd, 23;two sons of Sheikh Hussein Abdi Gaye, 8 and 19; Bashir Jama Abdullahi, 16; anda girl who used to work in a local vegetable shop. The firstnight they killed Mohmmed Abdi Wayd by strangling him, and threw his bodyoutside their base. The next day, the villagers found the bodies of theother four detainees, shot to death. Following the summary executions, most ofthe population of Lahelow fled the area, and soldiers burned some of the homes.[90]  The army brought 10 commandeered civiliantrucks to move the remaining civilian population of Lahelow to Wafdug town.[91]The army continued to summarily execute civilians who werefound in the "closed" zone of Lahelow. A few weeks after the killing of thefive civilians, soldiers shot dead a local official from Lahelow, SulubMohammed Elmi, when he tried to return home to the village.[92]  In mid-September 2007, soldiers allegedlyshot dead a group of five young camel herders near Lahelow, includingAbdulrahman Hassan, 19, and confiscated their camels.[93]Malqaqa, June 2007In June 2007 soldiers came to Malqaqa, a settlement of 40farms in the Fiiq wereda of Fiiq zone, and ordered the villagers to relocate tothe neighboring, larger villageof Galalshe, where therewas an army base. After removing the residents, the soldiers burned all of thefarms in the village and destroyed the crops. Soldiers dug up the khat plants, which were the mainstay ofthe farms, to ensure that villagers would not return to their homes. Aneyewitness from Malqaqa told Human Rights Watch that many of the young men fromMalqaqa were detained by the army at their base in Galalshe, where theysuffered beatings and abuse.[94]Warandhaab, June 2007According to a witness, in late June 2007, soon after ONLFfighters ambushed an army convoy near the village of Warandhaab,located on the main road between Kabridahar and Sheygoosh, in Korahe zone,soldiers burned the village:Usually, the soldiers leave their camps [in the main towns]to carry out [counterinsurgency] operations. If the soldiersare ambushed [by the ONLF], then the villages near the ambush are burned.This is what happened in Warandhaab. The soldiers came into the village andtold all the villagers to leave and move to Galadiid village. Then, Warandhaabwas burned down. Warandhaab had about 40 houses.[95]Wardheer town, July 2007Residents of urban centers have not been spared forcedresettlement during 2007. After residents of small rural settlements inWardheer wereda were ordered to move to Wardheer town and had their villagesburned down (see above), the Ethiopian army began ordering residents living onthe outskirts of Wardheer town to move towards the center of town. Soldiersthen began to burn some kebele (neighborhoods) in the town itself. According totwo separate eyewitnesses, the army burned parts of kebeles 1 and 4, andQoddobaha kebele in July.[96]One of the residents removed from kebele 4 told Human Rights Watch:I had an iron sheet house and an adjoining hut inneighborhood 4 of Wardheer town. The soldiers came one morning in July, andsaid, "[name removed], get out of here." They were removing residents fromthree [kebeles], 1, 4, and Qoddobaha, and telling people to move deeper intotown.[97]A second eyewitness confirmed that the three neighborhoodshad been partially burned and destroyed, adding that "all of the suburbanneighborhoods of Wardheer had their residents moved deeper into town."[98]Reprisal KillingsIn addition to the forced displacement, village burnings andkillings associated with the government's systematic campaign to removecivilian populations from rural, conflict-affected areas, Ethiopianforces have also carried out a large number of reprisal killings and otherserious rights violations.In most of the several dozen incidents involving willfulkillings or summary executions investigated by Human Rights Watch, the armedforces carried out reprisal attacks against civilians after clashes betweenONLF fighters and government soldiers near their villages, or after receivinginformation that ONLF fighters had visited particular villages (often bytracing presumed ONLF tracks). The military has also sought to pressure therelatives and village elders to produce ONLF members, and has detained orkilled those who are unable to comply with the order. This is a form ofcollective punishment. The laws of war do not permit belligerent reprisalsduring internal armed conflicts,[99]and collective punishments are prohibited outright.[100]Dalal, February 2007In mid-February 2007, ENDFsoldiers came to Dalal village, near Qorrahey village (in Korahe zone), andordered the civilian population to gather for a meeting. At the meeting, thesoldiers accused the residents of supporting and feeding ONLF forces. SheikhMohammed and two other village elders told the soldiers they were wrong, sayingthat their own children were starving and it would be impossible to providefood to the ONLF. The soldiers then accused Sheikh Mohammed's eldest son ofhaving died fighting for the ONLF, when in fact he had died fighting for theEthiopian army in Badme during the Ethiopia-Eritrean conflict. Sheikh Mohammedand the two other elders argued back, and the soldiers took them away andsummarily executed them.When the soldiers returned the bodies of the three elders tothe village, the remaining crowd became enraged. The soldiers began beating anddetaining some of the women. Among those detained was the 22-year-old daughterof one of the elders, whom the soldiers beat and raped before releasing.[101]Gurdumi, April 2007In early April 2007, an ENDF force came to the village of Gurdumi in Aware wereda, Dhagahbur zone,and the military commander ordered the population to gather at the center ofthe village, near the administration office. In his speech, the commanderordered the villagers to bring back their ONLF relatives from the bush. Themilitary commander then held lengthy talks with the village elders, whoexplained to him that they had no power to order ONLF relatives to return fromthe bush, let alone arrest them. The commander allegedly threatened the elders,saying that those who failed to bring back their "sons" would be killed.A few hours after the meeting,the commander ordered the arrest of the elders. Four or five elders, includingAbdullahi Qabille, a local official, and Hiiray Farah were brought to thevillage center and summarily executed. The army displayed their bodies, andrefused the villagers immediate permission to bury them. Several others,including village elder Sheikh Yusuf Abdullahi, were detained and remainunaccounted for.[102]Gudhis, June 2007In June 2007 heavy fightingoccurred between ONLF insurgents and government troops in the area aroundGudhis town, in the Gudhis wereda of Gode zone. A week after the fighting, ENDFsoldiers entered Gudhis early in the morning, confiscated five goats, andreturned to the nearby bush to slaughter and eat them. The same afternoon, thesoldiers returned to Gudhis and detained eight men and a woman. The woman,Fadumo Hashi Aden, and one of the men, Abdiwahad Hassan, were releasedunharmed. The other seven men were shot near the village, according to aresident whose relatives were among the dead. Those killed were Rashid GamadiidAbdurahman, Mohammed Mawsar Adan, Ibrahim Geed Abdiweli, Mohammedweli Shukri,Daabuul Mohammed Shukri, Mohammed Good Aden, and Ibrahim Hashi Abdi.[103]Aleen, July 2007In early July 2007, fighting took place between governmentforces and ONLF fighters near the villageof Aleen (also known asCaleen), northeast of Shilabo town in Korahe zone. Following the fighting, ENDFsoldiers entered the villageof Aleen with theirwounded. The soldiers, angry because of their losses, began killing civiliansin and around the village, accusing them of supporting the ONLF. Among thosekilled that afternoon was Fatumo Abdi Hussein, 80, the mother of ONLF fighterNur Faalug Mohamoud. Also killed were two boys, one of them Fatumo's grandson,Abdullahi Yare Mohamoud Faalug.[104]As the village was burying the dead the next day, thesoldiers returned and opened fire on the mourners, killing at least two and asmany as four village elders, including Sheikh Ibrahim Farah and Mohammed AbdiMuse. After the shooting, most of the villagers fled in fear, and soldiers setthe village on fire. According to an eyewitness: "They burnedAleen village on this very same day. The people fled the village becauseof the army's entrance and the killings that took place. But in the afternoonwe saw from a distance the smoke from the burning village."[105]A second eyewitness who was present in Aleen during itsdestruction recalled that the army commander had ordered the village evacuatedbefore the burning:I fled with my wife and children [from Lahelow] to Aleen,which is closer to Shilabo. In Aleen, there is a motorized borehole. We wentthere to look for water. The soldiers came to Aleen, after they burned downLahelow. Then they burned Aleen. We were there at the time. The soldiersarrived and ordered the people out of their homes. They gathered all of thepeople together. Then the commander ordered the village burned. The commandertold us, "I have told you already to leave these small villages," and then theyforced us out. Then they burned down all the homes. The houses are just huts,so it is easy to burn them.[106]Qoriley, July 2007One of the more gruesome summary executions by Ethiopianforces took place on July24, 2007 near Qoriley village in Wardheer zone. During the earlymorning hours, approximately 400 soldiers from the military base in Danoodarrived in Qoriley, and then gathered the villagers together for a speech bythe military commander. According to an eyewitness:The soldiers entered some houses and took money, food andclothes as they made their way to an old [abandoned] army base in Qoriley. Ataround 1 p.m., they cameout of the base and gathered people around a number of large trees in thevillage. There were three Somali men who were guiding the army [nameswithheld]. These Somali men talked to the people, translating the speech of thearmy commander [name withheld].[107]Human Rights Watch interviewedtwo additional witnesses who gave very similar accounts of the commander'sspeech. He accused the population of Qoriley of supporting the ONLF, and of notdoing enough to bring their ONLF relatives back from the bush, reportedly tellingthe civilians, "We've been very patient with you, but today our patience hasrun out."[108]The Somali interpreter then read out a list of nine men and two women to bedetained. Those detained were Hassan Burale Elmi and his brother Ali BuraleElmi, who had another brother in the ONLF; Ahmed Gani Guled; Hassan AbdiAbdullahi; Farah Hussein Halosi; Abdi-hiis Sheikh Mohamoud Umar; Ilmoge Beddel;Kifah Rage; Bogos Shukri Mataan; and two women, Ayan Ali Good and RidwanHassan-rage Sahid, who were accused of being the wives of ONLF members.[109]Following their arrests, thenine men and two women were taken to the Qoriley military camp, which thesoldiers had reoccupied that morning. During the night, the soldiers severelybeat the two most senior elders in the group, Farah Hussein Halosi and HassanBurale Elmi, breaking Hassan Burale Elmi's hand. The two detained women werealso beaten (but not raped), and accused of being married to ONLF members.[110]The next morning, the soldiers released the youngest of thedetainees, Kifah Rage, and ordered him to walk a flock of goats to the Danoodarmy base. The remaining 10 detainees were walked to Babaase village, about anhour's walk from Qoriley, where they spent a second night in detention.Several eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watchdescribed how the villagers found the strangled bodies of the 10 detainees afew days later outside Babaase village. A businessman from the Qorile area toldHuman Rights Watch what he had seen: "All the [detainees] were taken to Babaasewhere they were strangled with ropes. I saw the ropes on their neck when wearrived [at] the scene. I saw the bodies of Ahmed Ghani Guled, Farah HusseinHalosi, and Ayan Ali Good."[111]One of the detainees, Ridwan Hassan-rage Sahid, survived thestrangulation, and later told Human Rights Watch what she had experienced.[112]She explained that the soldiers and the detainees had left the army camp in twogroups, and the detainees were strangled soon after they left Babaase. Woundson her neck appeared consistent with the attempted strangulation she described:It was still early morning, before day break, and we werein a forested area. After a while, the soldiers stopped us under some trees,next to a water-well. The soldiers undressed all the men before they strangledthem. They took away their sarongs, watches, and shoes. The women were notundressed.They took away two men, Ilmoge Beddel and Abdi-hiis SheikMohamoud Umar. They put a rope around the neck of each of them as we stoodwatching. Then, they hanged Ilmoge from a tree, after a soldier climbed intothe tree and put the rope around a branch. But they did not hang Abdi-hiis.Instead, they put the rope around his neck and two soldiers pulled in oppositedirections, strangling him.Then I was taken away with two men, Hassan Abdi Abdullahiand Ahmed Gani Guled. First they pulled ropes around the necks of the two menand pulled in opposite directions, and both fell down. They put me in a ditchwhile they were strangling the other two. One soldier tried to strangle me withthe metal stick used for cleaning the gun [by pushing it down on my throat],but I twisted his finger until he released me. Then two other soldiers came andthey put a rope around my neck and started pulling.That is the last thing I remember, until I woke up still inthe ditch. A naked body was on top of me, it was Ahmed Gani Guled, who wasdead. I couldn't move out of the ditch until I was found by some women who cameto the waterhole.[113]All other nine detainees were found strangled to death.Speaking on condition ofanonymity, a regional government official confirmed to Human Rights Watch thatthe Ethiopian army had strangled up to 12 detainees in Qoriley. According tothe official, the attack on Qoriley occurred shortly after ONLF forcesdestroyed a commercial truck belonging to the Marehan clan outside Qoriley, andthe elders of Qoriley refused to provide compensation to the Marehan clansmen.The regional official told Human Rights Watch that the actions of the army hadoutraged some civilian officials, who had gone to complain to the militaryabout the Qoriley killings, but no soldiers had been arrested or punitiveaction taken by the army.[114]Galalshe and San-Xaskule, August 2007After forcing most of the rural population to relocate tothe larger villageof Galalshe which washome to an ENDF military base (see above), soldiers in August 2007 burned manyof Galalshe's 400 civilian homes. The burning of Galalshe and other villages inthe area was apparently in retaliation for heavy fighting between governmentforces from Galalshe and ONLF fighters in the nearby DaakhatoValley,four hours' walk away. As the soldiers began burning homes in Galalshe, theinhabitants tried to stop them. In response, the soldiers opened fire on thecivilians, killing between eight and 15 civilians, including Mohamoud RageEgal, 60, Abdulkadir Rage Egal (Mohamoud's brother), Aydid Muhumed Egal, SheikhAbdullaahi Omar Egal, Farah Abdi Bade, Omar Faruk Mohammed, Fadumo MohamoudRage, and Dalha.[115]San-Xaskule, another village in the area, was also burnedaround the same time by army forces, and five civilians were reportedly killedthere, including Mohammed Abdi Samad, Fadumo, Mohammed Abdi "Arab," and HalimoSharif Mohammed.[116]Bukudhaba, August 2007Around August17, 2007, fierce fighting took place between the army and ONLFforces near the villages of Bukudhaba, Milmil, and Haahi, in Awarewereda, Dhagahbur zone. Afterwards, ENDF soldiers entered Bukudhaba village onAugust 18, killing at least eight civilians, including six elders, and burneddown Bukudhaba and other villages in the area.Bukudhaba was a large village of some 200 households locatedsouth of Aware town, and is famous for its large waterreservoirs, which serve the pastoralist communities in the area. According tothe villagers, Bukudhaba was also regularly visited by ONLF forces.[117]Several witnesses recounted to Human Rights Watch how thesoldiers came to Bukudhaba the morning after the fighting and executed a groupof elders at the village mosque before burning down the village. One man toldHuman Rights Watch:The soldiers came early in the morning, they were lookingfor men. They went to the mosque and found elders who were praying at themosque, and shot five elders inside the mosque, including some guests to thevillage. They killed a sixth man outside the mosque.[118]Several others gave Human Rights Watch similar accounts ofthe killings at the mosque. Although she was not in Bukudhaba at the time ofthe attack, a relative of Hiis Sulub Dagaal, an elder who was partially blind,told Human Rights Watch that he had been shot and killed during the attack onBukudhaba:He had left Dhagahbur because the army had confiscated allof our properties, so he went to stay […] in Bukudhaba. [During the attack,]only the elderly were left in the village; they found [Hiis Sulub Dagaal] andsix other men at the mosque. They shot them. I don't know whether they killedthem in the mosque or outside the mosque, I was only told they were shot. He isburied in the village.[119]The soldiers returned the next day to burn down the village,and killed two more men, Yusuf Dhiriq and Abdullahi Mohammed Ismael, as well asa woman, Fadumo Ahmed Ali, accusing them of belonging to the ONLF.[120]"They shot people and started burning the village," said a 42-year-old man who describedthe burning of Bukudhaba to Human Rights Watch.When they were burning Bukudhaba, I was in Baarta villagewhich is less than a kilometer away, and I could see the smoke. The armyproceeded to Baarta and burned that village also. Bukudhaba is a big village ofabout 200 houses with two water reservoirs. They damaged the water reservoirsby blowing up the wooden walls with explosives. This happened on the same daythey burned Bukudhaba.[121]Rape andOther Sexual ViolenceHuman Rights Watch research found that the Ethiopian armedforces have been responsible for numerous instances of sexual and gender-basedviolence against women and girls in conflict-affected areas of Somali Region.Women taken into military custody as suspected ONLF spies or for providing theinsurgents military support are frequently raped or otherwise sexuallyassaulted while being transported to or held in military camps. Soldiers havealso assaulted and raped women and girls in urban areas as well as when theyare collecting firewood, water, and other vital supplies in rural areas thatthe ENDF considers "closed."  HumanRights Watch is unaware of any instances since 2007 in which soldiers have beendisciplined or punished for committing acts of sexual violence.Rape and other sexual violence isprohibited under the laws of war and is a war crime.[122]  When committed as part of a widespread orsystematic attack on a civilian population, it is a crime against humanity.[123]Rape of Women in Military CustodyHuman Rights Watch has documented cases of rape of femaledetainees by government soldiers at military bases in Wardheer, Dhagahbur,Kabridahar, Jijiga, Shilabo, Duhun, and Fiiq towns, and many smaller militarybases in the conflict-affected zones, indicating that rape is a widespreadabuse in the region. According to many of the women and men interviewed byHuman Rights Watch, rape of female detainees regularly occurs in militarycustody and often involves senior military officials, including basecommanders, and interrogators.In June 2007 a 38-year-old woman was detained by soldiers asshe entered Dhagahbur town from her home in Kariir to sell some goats. She wastaken by the soldiers to the brigade headquarters. She told Human Rights Watchthat during her 25-day detention, soldiers had raped her on five separateoccasions before she was transferred to a police station.[124]In June 2007, soldiers arrested a 17-year-old student fromher home in Duhun, in Duhun wereda, Fiiq zone, accusing her of being an ONLFsupporter. The nine soldiers took her to the Duhun military base, where she wasdetained together with about 15 other female students in a dark hole in theground. The soldiers beat her on the first night of her detention, and thenbeat and raped her the second night. During her three-month detention, she wasraped at least 13 times. According to the student, most of the 40 or so womenwho were detained at various times during those three months were raped, andthe camp commander himself participated in the rapes:Every night, they took all of us girls to [interrogations].They would separate us and beat us.The second time they took me, they raped me. It is hard totalk about, a man who is more powerful than you can do whatever he wants to you,so they violated me and raped me as they wanted. All three of the men raped me,consecutively. Then we were returned to the hole.I was in a lot of pain and there was no doctor, until todayI have not seen a doctor. I was held in the prison for three months, and rapedon at least 12 other occasions, by different groups of soldiers. The commanderof the base also participated in the rapes and beatings. We were all raped-thegirls and the mothers. They brought new girls and women all the time, at least 40girls and women were detained during the three months I was there.[125]On May 23, 2007, the day after fighting in the area betweenthe army and ONLF forces, the soldiers detained some villagers, including twowomen and a 16-year-old girl from Toon-Eli village in Korahe zone and took themto the Dhuumo-Dhumodle army base in Kabridahar. The two women and girl weredetained there with another nine women, many of them relatives. Soldiers rapedat least seven of the 12 women. On the night of May 29-30, soldiers executedSahan Hussein and Khadar Ali Hussein in front of the other female detainees bystrangling them with ropes after forcing them to confess to being ONLF members.[126]In addition to these cases, based on victims' accounts, manyother former detainees reported witnessing rapes or seeing strong evidence ofrape, such as women and girls who returned to their cells with ripped clothes,and bleeding from their private parts. A 19-year-old university studentstudying in Addis Ababawho was detained in Dhagahbur town in May 2007 when he returned home for aholiday, and kept for two months at a military base there, witnessed severalsuch cases. During his detention, he saw a severely injured 23-year-old womanwho was suffering from a swollen belly and an injured right arm after soldiersapparently raped her. She died from her injuries while at the base.[127]A 30-year-old shopkeeper from Wardheer town was detainedfrom early May until July 28, 2007 at the "Transport Tanks" military base inWardheer town, accused of providing economic support to the ONLF. He told HumanRights Watch of several cases of rape of women detainees that he personallywitnessed:The women were accused of supporting the ONLF, cooking foodfor the fighters and spying for the ONLF. Most of the women were being raped.As we were moved outside our room, I witnessed women who were interrogated andraped. I saw with my own eyes two girls being raped, at different times. Wecould hear their screams and could see these things with our own eyes. One girl was raped by five soldiers onenight I was taken out, I was handcuffed at the time, and another time two girlswere being raped just meters away from me. All the time when they interviewedthe girls, they used to force them to undress themselves. Six soldiers werewith the two girls when I saw them being raped; the interrogator was therealso. When the women refused to answer the questions, the interrogatorallowed the soldiers to rape them.[128]In mid-May 2007, patrolling army soldiers detained a groupof women and men from a small, unnamed nomadic settlement about two kilometerssouth of Shilabo town. The group was divided into several groups and told theywould be taken to the military base in Shilabo for questioning. One of thewomen described how soldiers had taken her and another 10 women into a nearbyforest, where they were beaten and raped before being left for dead:Before we reached the town, the soldiers started beating uswith thick sticks. They beat me very hard until I fell to the ground. This timewhile lying on the ground I was raped. I don't know how many men raped me.Other women were raped too. It is a woodland area. We were about ten women, allof us were raped.After the rape, some of the soldiers continued beatingwomen, others were strangled with a rope but they didn't die. In our group, wewere shot. I was hit behind the left shoulder with a bullet. The army left usin the woodland. We were found by townspeople who took us to the town.[129]Sexual Violence against Women Collecting Wood and WaterOn May 8, 2007, army soldiers detained a 20-year-oldcharcoal seller from Kabridahar town while she was collecting wood near themilitary base in the Bam Burat area. The soldiers accused her of spying for theONLF, and immediately began beating her with the wood she had collected andjumping on her body. At least three soldiers raped the woman. She lostconsciousness from the beatings and the repeated rapes, and woke up nine dayslater at the military base in Kabridahar. After she was detained a month, heruncle managed to secure her release from the military base. She requiredextensive medical treatment for her wounds.[130]In July 2007 patrolling soldiers from the Garbo base rapedtwo young women on consecutive days as they went to fetch water from wellslocated a day's walk from their homes in Fiiq zone. The first woman wasdetained by the soldiers around noonas she left the wells; two soldiers raped her and threw her off a cliff,causing her serious injuries. The second woman, who had just given birth to herfirst child, was detained around the same time the next day, and raped by threesoldiers. Angry villagers protested by throwing stones at the army encampment.When the soldiers responded with gunfire, the villagers fled.[131]Arbitrary Detention, Abuse and Torture, and Execution ofDetaineesFor years, the Ethiopian armed forces and other securityservices, including the police, have detained hundreds of civilians forallegedly being ONLF members or supporters. Periods in detention without chargerange from a few days to-more commonly-several months or even years, anddetainees are often re-arrested upon release, even if they change locations.Although persons from all backgrounds and ages-includingmany elders-have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, government securityforces have targeted certain groups – market traders, school and universitystudents, business leaders, and opposition politicians-on suspicion of spying,organizing, or providing financial or other support to the ONLF. Others havebeen detained simply because they have relatives in the ONLF, or after havingdisagreements with military officials (such as demanding compensation forvehicles commandeered by the army).Individuals arrested are held in a variety of detentionfacilities: military bases, federal police prisons, and local, administrativepolice facilities. There are also unofficial detention centers. In Jijiga alonethere are a range of detention centers, four or five of which were repeatedlymentioned to Human Rights Watch by former detainees who had suffered orwitnessed abuses: the Regional Central Prison known as "Jail Ogaden" (becauseof the large numbers of Ogaadeeni held there) which reportedly holds between400 to 600 prisoners; kebele and wereda jails, of which the center in Jijiga'skebele 4 is the most notorious-it holds several hundred prisoners in a range ofconditions, including underground cells;Jijiga's military bases-Garabcase and the air defense facility calledAyer Hail; and Qumaadaha, a former police training center located in Jijiga'skebele 5, which is reported to hold prisoners of national security interest andpolitical detainees.[132]Although there appear to be few judicial protections fordetainees across the spectrum of detention facilities in Somali Region, thelikelihood of mistreatment appears to be greatest for persons held in militarycustody, where most detainees find themselves outside the reach of Ethiopia'slegal system. Legal requirements limiting the period of detention without chargeand requiring judicial oversight of detentions are routinely ignored.[133]Almost all persons formerly held in military detention interviewed by HumanRights Watch suffered severe beatings and torture. As described above, detainedwomen and girls have routinely been raped at military bases and Human RightsWatch has also documented several dozen extrajudicial executions in militarybases, sometimes carried out in front of other detainees in order to terrorizethem into confessing involvement with the ONLF.The mistreatment of persons in custody is a seriousviolation of both the laws of war[134]and international human rights law.[135]  Detained individuals must be treated humanelyat all times; it is irrelevant whether or not they are members or supporters ofan armed opposition group.While there has been a surge of arrests since the April 2007ONLF attack on Obole, arbitrary detention and torture in military custody arelong-standing problems in Somali Region. Many former detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch recounted not only the abuse they suffered in militarycustody after the April 2007 attack, but also similar arbitrary arrests andabuse they had personally experienced previously, often dating back to the late1990s and early 2000s.For example, Amina, a 19-year-old student, told Human RightsWatch how she was detained in 2003 (when she was 15) for nine months, thenagain in 2006 for six months, and fled Ethiopia when the soldiers came lookingfor her again following the Obole attack in April 2007. During both periods ofmilitary detention, she suffered regular, severe beatings and torture.[136]Muhumed, an 18-year-old student, told Human Rights Watch how he had beendetained at military camps in Dhageh Medow for three months in 2004 (when hewas 15), for 19 days in May 2006, and for nine months in December 2006. He toldHuman Rights Watch about the beatings and torture he endured during his lastdetention:I was taken out from my home the last time and they broughtme to the military camp and they beat me for three hours. They accused me ofbeing with the ONLF and giving them help. I told them I was a student….At firstthey beat me on my head with sticks, and then they beat me with an electricrope all over my body. One was kicking me. Then they tied my hands behind myback. Then they spoke to me for hours, they said if I tell them the truth theywould release me. I told them, "I told you the truth already, before you beatme. I have no information about what you are talking about." One of them then kickedme in the face and I lost a tooth. I was in a lot of pain. The next two nightsthey beat me the same way. They tied me out in the sun for the whole day, nextto the guard house.[137]Arbitrary Arrest and DetentionMany of the former military detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch claimed that they had been arrested on suspicion of supporting theONLF without any evidence to support such suspicions.[138] Asone young man put it bitterly, "Anyone with a bowl of water is suspected ofsupplying the ONLF."[139]A young woman voiced the same sentiment, saying "If you make tea in a teashop,the army would accuse you that the man who bought tea is an ONLF member….Thereis no way to escape."[140]Indeed, the cases investigated by Human Rights Watchindicate that the armed forces arrest those they suspect of supporting the ONLFon the slimmest conjecture, and then attempt to beat and torture confessions.Most of the former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch denied havingany connection to the ONLF, although some people mentioned having relatives,often distant relatives, involved in the ONLF. This is an insufficient basisfor detention.The military's broad, unchecked power to arbitrarily arrest,detain, and abuse suspects is illustrated by the case of Ruqiya, a prominenttrade woman in Dhagahbur. In March 2007, she was transporting a truckload ofgrain from Aware to Dhagahbur when soldiers stopped her, demanded she offloadthe truck, and then commandeered the vehicle. When the vehicle was laterdestroyed in an ONLF ambush, her husband went to the police to report the lossand ask for compensation. That same night, soldiers took her husband, sayingthey just wanted to question him and would soon return him. The husband has notbeen seen again.When Ruqiya and male elders from her clan went to the armybase the next day to inquire about her husband, the soldiers accused her oflying, saying her husband had run off with the ONLF, and promptly detained herat the military camp. That same night, the camp commander viciously beat her:When the sun came down, the commander came and they put mein a dark hole. He started asking me lots of questions. He then started beatingme with a strong stick, on the head and on the legs, and another also beat mewith his gun. They were telling me that I was distributing food to the rebelsand that they would kill me. They took off my headcover, but they left me withmy clothes. They beat me like this for about half an hour. I was terrified thatI would be killed.[141]Her clan elders finally convinced the military commander torelease her so she could be hospitalized for her injuries. However, after herrelease, she found her store had been closed with a government seal, and thatall of her stock had been impounded by the authorities. Afraid she would be"disappeared" like her husband, she fled to Kenya.[142]Torture and BeatingsAlmost all of the former detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch who were detained on military bases reported severe beatings andtorture during their arrest and interrogation. Detainees frequently reportedbeing beaten and tortured to the point of unconsciousness. Sexual violenceagainst female detainees occurs frequently at military bases, as discussedabove. Torture, beatings, and sexual violence all appear to be an officiallytolerated practice by military commanders, and there are incidents of basecommanders personally participating in all such abuses.Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 30 victims ofsevere beatings and torture at military bases and has documented several dozenadditional cases from family members of victims and former detainees. Theseabuses took place at military bases throughout the conflict-affected area,including in Jijiga, Wardheer, Kabridahar, Dhagahbur, Shilabo, Fiiq, Hamaro, Dhuhun,Qoriley, Gabagabo, Isku Dholey, Higlaleey, Dhagahmadow, Garbo, Yu'ub,Sheygoosh, and Harar, indicating that beatings and torture are a routine andwidely tolerated practice at military bases. Many additional cases of beatingsand torture were documented involving army soldiers on patrol or when stayingat temporary military bases during patrols.Soldiers typically start violently beating persons almost assoon as they are taken into custody. Twenty-four-year-old Ayan told HumanRights Watch how she began being beaten within earshot of her home aftersoldiers came to arrest her in the middle of the night:During the night, the soldiers came to our home. We wereasleep. They knocked at the door and my mother opened the door. They said,"Where is your daughter?  We need to askher some questions."  There were at least10 soldiers.As soon as I left the house, they started beating me – mymother could hear my screams. They were beating me with wooden batons. Three ofthem were beating me while the others were holding my arms. They just startedbeating me without saying anything. I lost all of the feeling after a while,the beating was very bad.[143]Twenty-year-old Faduma, a student from Shilabo town, wasrepeatedly taken from her home at night in July 2007 to be questioned bysoldiers about suspected links to the ONLF. The first two nights, she was notseriously harmed, but on the third time she was taken from her home, thesoldiers beat her unconscious, leaving her for dead:The next [third] night, at 4 a.m. or so, three Ethiopian soldiers came to my houseagain. Two were dressed in military uniforms, theother had his face covered with a piece of white cloth. Unlike the previousnight, they pulled me outside right away by my scarf, and locked the house andtook me with them violently. They slapped me two times, and told me to walkwith them.I was taken towards the military camp called "Darash."There is a water-well between the town and the camp. They threatened to throwme inside the well if I didn't confess to them. They threatened to strangle meif I didn't confess, and throw my body into the well. At that moment, theybegan slapping and kicking me, and punching me with their fists, throwing mefrom one to the other.The investigator withdrew a pistol from his waistband andthreatened, "If you don't confess, I will force you to tell me everything youknow with this pistol."  I was confusedand felt helpless, so I started crying. He ordered the soldiers to beat me untilI confessed. Besides threatening to rape me, they said they would use thepistol to kill me. They threw me down on a pile of garbage. As I fell down, oneof the soldiers kicked me in the back. At that moment, they left me on the pileof garbage and I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I found aherder who was watering his animals by the well holding my hand.[144]Once at the military camps, the detainees are regularlytaken from their cells for "interrogation." Soldiers order the detainees toconfess involvement with the ONLF, which often involves severe beatings to thepoint of unconsciousness. A 30-year-old shopkeeper from Wardheer town describedthe beatings and torture he received at the "Transport Tanks" military base onthe town's eastern outskirts:I was taken to the military camp, to an investigativeofficer called Hailu. He and two soldiers accompanied me and took me to a roomin the camp, it had no door that could be closed, itwas just an open room. It had garbage inside, it was filthy. They said, "Youwill tell us the truth or you will die here."I replied to them that I don't have any lies to tell them, because Idon't support those people [ONLF]. They insisted I tell them about my financialsupport to the rebels, and they questioned me for some minutes, telling me to tellthem the truth, that I was with the ONLF. I refused to admit to such things,and then the investigator ordered the two soldiers to start beating me.They started beating me with the backs of their AK-47 guns.They hit me once with the gun in my face, and then started beating me. Theyalso hit me with the gun barrel in my teeth, and broke one of my teeth. Thenthey started beating me with a fanbelt on my back and my feet. It lasted formore than one hour. Then they tied both my legs and lifted me upside down tothe ceiling with a rope, and kept beating me more, saying I had to confess.For two months, we underwent this same ordeal, being takenfrom our rooms at night and being beaten and tortured. They were selective, noteveryone was beaten this badly every time. It was just a random process,different people suffered differently. They would beat me about two to threetimes a week, at least.[145]Ahmed, a 22-year old student, was arrested in July 2006 onsuspicion of supporting the ONLF, and taken to the military base in Dhagahbur.He described how he was interrogated and beaten virtually nightly for 18nights, and remained in poor health from the beatings when interviewed by HumanRights Watch more than one year later:I was tortured a lot at this camp. When the night came,they took me to a separate room. I was beaten the first night, with sticks andalso kicked. They kicked me in the head and in the left kidney,I still have problems with my vision now. The first night they didn't ask meanything, they just beat and kicked me. Five soldiers did the beating. I wasbeaten to the point of unconsciousness.The next day they left me alone [until the evening]. Atnight, they came to get me and took me to the room. There were five soldiers.They interrogated me, saying I was working with the ONLF, this was the firsttime they asked me any questions. One of them was speaking to me in Somali. Itold them I was a student and just studied my lessons, and had nothing to dowith the rebels. They started beating me again, and one of them punched me veryhard in the private parts and I became unconscious. They took me back to myroom…In the evening, the soldiers came again. It was for 18 nightsconsecutively, that is why I am still very sick now. Then, they beat me everyfew days. I was kept in the camp for two months. Then I was transferred to thepolice jail until August 2007. I was never brought in front of a judge for trial, they just kept me [detained] like this.[146]Extrajudicial Executions at Military BasesAccording to eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch,Ethiopian soldiers have carried out extrajudicial executions of detainees at anumber of military bases in Somali Region, including military bases inWardheer, Dhagahbur, Duhun, Hamaro, and Shilabo. In most of these cases, thedetainees were extrajudicially executed in front of the other detainees at themilitary camp, often in the presence of the camp's military commander,demonstrating high-level responsibility.Following the May 28, 2007 grenade explosions in Dhagahbur, the armyextrajudicially executed two students and two nomads at the military base inDhagahbur. An 18-year-old student detained alongside the two students who wereexecuted explained to Human Rights Watch that they were part of a group of fivestudents, between 16 and 18, who had been arrested at the Makhtal Dahir school in May 2005, and since then imprisoned at a prison inDhagahbur town on charges of supporting the ONLF. He explained how after theMay 28 grenade attacks, soldiers came to the prison, read out the names of thefour to be executed, and then took them away to the military base:After the explosions in Dhagahbur in May, two of thestudents detained with us were killed. They killed Beddel Mohamoud Abdi andHussein Abdi Farah. One night they were taken out by the army. They were killedwith two other men, nomads, who were detained from the countryside. One of themwas called Ahmednasir Dahir. Before they were killed, the army came and readout their names and were taken to the kifletor (division) where theywere killed. The kifletor is very near to the regional headquarters.[147]The bodies of the four victims were found outside themilitary base on May 30, showing signs of strangulation. Since the studentsexecuted by the soldiers had been in detention since May 2005, they could nothave played a direct role in the grenade explosions in Dhagahbur on May 28, 2007. It appearsthat their execution was a military-sanctioned act of reprisal for the grenadeattacks.Halima, a 17-year-old student from Duhun, told Human RightsWatch how she had personally witnessed the execution of two of her classmateswhile being detained at a military base in Duhun. In front of an estimated 65detainees, the military commander of the camp tried to force the two girls toconfess to being ONLF members before ordering their summary execution:I witnessed the killing of two girls. They wanted tointimidate the rest of us, so they brought the two girls who they said were thestrongest ONLF supporters. They made the rest of us watch while they killed thetwo girls. First they tried to get them to confess, saying they would kill themotherwise. Then they shot both of them with their guns.Their names were Faduma Hassan, 17, and Samsam Yusuf, 18.Both were students. They were my classmates. We were all just students, we had nothing to do with the ONLF. This was thesecond day after I arrived in the jail, at lunchtime. The commander was presentat the time of the killings, he was the one speakingto the girls. All of the detainees, girls and boys, had to watch the killings.We were about 65 in total at that stage.[148]A 19-year-old student from Hamero town in Hamero wereda,Fiiq zone, told Human Rights Watch how the Ethiopian army detained two malestudents suspected of involvement in the ONLF in early June, and strangled themto death inside the military base before throwing out the bodies. She herselfwent to see the mutilated bodies, which lay unburied in the streets for twodays before the military commander allowed them to be buried:Some of our students were killed after the oil incident.Ahmed Mohammed, 18, a student, was killed. He was arrested many times before.After the oil incident, they took him to the military compound in June 2007 andthey killed him. They strangled him. I saw his body,he had suffered a lot of torture. But if we cry and recognized his body, theywould have arrested us also. After they killed him, they threw his body intothe street. They initially refused to allow his relatives to bury the body, butafter two days, they gave permission to allow to burythe body. He had been arrested two times before this time. Then, they justarrested and killed him.Another one was killed together with him, another student,Mohammed Omar, 17, he was also strangled the same way.He had been arrested four days before he was killed. They were not studentleaders or Ogadeni activists, but they were accused of supporting the ONLF.They have some distant relatives who are ONLF soldiers, not commanders.[149]From May to July 2007, at least seven detainees wereextrajudicially executed at the "Transport Tanks" military camp outside ofWardheer, according to a former detainee who was detained at the military campduring this period. According to the former detainee, the soldiers first tookfive men and women from the communal cell he shared, and killed them bystrangulation to terrorize the other detainees into confessing: "They take arope and wrap it around the person's neck, and then two soldiers pull fromopposite sides. Then, when the persons were dead, they would bring us to seethe bodies and tell us we were to die the same way if we don't confess tothem."[150]Among the five killed were Fartoum Ugas, in his 20s; Nour Abdi, about 25; DaherHussein, 21; a woman named Hawa, married and in her 30s; and a man in his 40sfrom Jinnoole village. The bodies were later taken away in a military truck,and may have been buried on the grounds of the military base.[151]A few nights later, a man in his mid-40s and an older woman were removed fromthe same communal cell in the evening. The next morning, the detainees sawtheir bodies near the washing facilities, and noticed that the man had visiblehead injuries and bleeding (the woman's body was covered with a blanket).[152]Former Detainees and Collective PunishmentMost of the former detainees interviewed by Human RightsWatch obtained their release from military detention after relatives paidbribes to military officials and stood as personal guarantors for the releaseddetainee. A few of the former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watchobtained their release by escaping from detention facilities. In most cases,released detainees were asked by their families to flee the region, so theywould not be re-arrested. When released and escaped detainees fled, themilitary authorities often responded by detaining their relatives orguarantors.Twenty-year-old Nimo was detained in December 2006 inShilabo, and spent three months in military detention and in police custody,suffering regular beatings and rape. After three months, she was finallyreleased when six clan elders stood as personal guarantors for her. When hermother took her to Kenyafor medical treatment and safety, two of the six elders were detained by themilitary, and later released on 5,000 Birr bail (about US$550).Khadra, a 17-year-old girl, was detained in Duhun militarybase for three months in 2007, suffering severe beatings and multiple rapes.Her father managed to collect 3,000 Birr (about $330) to pay to the militaryofficials as a bribe, and at least 12 elders stood as personal guarantors tothe military commander. Following her release, she fled to Kenya, and many of the elders whostood as guarantors were arrested and remained in detention at the time of theHuman Rights Watch interview in September 2007.[153]Forced Recruitment of Pro-Government MilitiasAnybody who works for the government-teachers, doctors,clerks, administrators-has to join a militia. I left because I didn't want todie.- Hassan Abdi Hees, head accountant[154]The Ethiopian military maintainsa significant presence in the major towns and some strategically importantvillages. However, the rural areas remain largely out of the military's controland so it relies heavily on locally recruited informers and militia formilitary intelligence, supplemental forces, and local knowledge. A formersoldier told Human Rights Watch, "There is no military presence in small towns.There is daba-qoodhi [collaborators] which the Ethiopian army calls 'tadaaqi'.Usually the commander of the brigade will ask the local elders to bring [boysand men] to help their army protect peace, the army provides [them] withweapons and ammunition."[155]Although the use and recruitment of local militia is alongstanding practice, in 2007 the Ethiopian authorities engaged in asystematic campaign of forced recruitment of local civilians intopro-government militias, ordering village elders to recruit specific quotas forthe militias, or provide money and weapons instead. In some villages, theauthorities have detained or killed elders or seized property to forcecivilians to comply with orders to join the militia.Civilians forced to join the militia are often sent intobattle without any military training. The forced recruits are generally lightlyarmed (at times, they are told to find their own weapons) and simply told to gofind and fight the ONLF. As a result, the forced recruits sufferdisproportionate casualties against the more experienced and better trainedONLF fighters.Since 2007 even government employees have been ordered topick up weapons and join pro-government militias, or risk being fined, fired,or detained. According to confidential sources as well as published accounts,Ethiopian officials have forced "untrained civilians-including doctors,teachers, office clerks and employees of development programs financed by theWorld Bank and United Nations-to fight rebels in the desolate Ogaden region."[156]In addition to this recent surge in forced recruitment ofpro-government forces, there are also a number of longer-establishedpro-government militias which tend to be more voluntarily recruited, most ofthem composed of the same Ogaadeeni subclans and some from non-Ogaadeeni clans.These militias are known as tadaaqi(literally, riflemen in Amharic).A former resident of Wardheer told Human Rights Watch of theforced recruitment efforts by the Ethiopian army in Wardheer town in June 2007,which led him to flee to Kenya.In June, a defecting ONLF officer called Adan Taani held a series of rallies inWardheer together with an Ethiopian commander, ordering members of the Abrahimsubclan of the Ogaadeen clan to form militias to fight the ONLF. The elders ofthe Abrahim subclan initially resisted the demands to form the militia,explaining to the army commander that it was difficult for them to ask theirfellow clansmen to join a pro-government militia at the same time as many oftheir families were being burned out of their rural homes by the army. Themilitary commander rejected their concerns, offering the elders a simplechoice: "The commander insisted guns should be taken up [against the ONLF]. Hegave the elders two options-[each family should] either bring a gun or a man toconfront the ONLF."[157]The witness went on to explain just how dangerous the work of the forcedrecruits was:Elders and fathers are forced either to bring their sons orbring a gun as a contribution to the fight. The militias are not trained: Theyare told to go out, find the ONLF, and fight them. Some of them join the ONLFwhen they find them in the bush, but most of the men cannot join [the ONLF]because they have families in the towns, and defecting would endanger thoselives.The daba-qoodhi(a derogatory term used to describe government collaborators) are told by Ethiopian commanders to go find the ONLF tracks,follow them and fight them. The tracks can be easily traced: the sand in thoseareas is soft and it is easily feasible to follow a track from three days ago. The ONLF march in lines, so they are easily traceable. Ifthey don't follow the tracks and return without a fight with the ONLF, eitherthey are sent back immediately or the team leader is replaced. Usually, theteam leaders are detained if they do not achieve gains against the ONLF.[158]In late June and early July 2007, several rallies wereorganized by pro-government militia leaders in Wardheer town, with the aims ofcollecting money and recruiting militia forces. Militia forces beat young menwho refused to attend, and closed the tea shops during the rallies to increaseattendance.[159]In mid-June 2007, officials in Wardheer ordered governmentemployees to take up weapons and fight together with regular army units againstthe ONLF. Even former government employees were pressured to join thepro-government militias, and threatened with detention or fines if theyrefused. Residents told Human Rights Watch that they observed armed civilianofficials being moved out of Wardheer later in June 2007, and also recognizedcivilian officials among the militia forces in some villages outside Wardheer.[160]In March 2007 army soldiers came to the village of Qarrijuqood,Duhun wereda, in Fiiq zone, seeking to forcibly recruit civilians to fightagainst the ONLF. One villager told Human Rights Watch how the soldiers came tohis 70-year-old father and told him to "volunteer" two of his five sons forrecruitment into the militia:My father is about 70 years of age. The army accused him ofrefusing to contribute men to fight alongside the army. The army wanted two ofus in particular – myself and the oldest [brother],32. The reason is because the other three were not suitable for the militia[One was a religious devotee who travels a lot; the other had a large family;while the third brother is only 15 years old].The army collected large numbers of men for recruitment.After few nights, [my brother] and the other newly recruited were taken ontrucks to another location. He was among four of the recruits who tried toescape on the way out of Duhun. They army shot them. My brother and a cousinMohamoud Abdi Jiiliye died; the other two escaped.We moved out of Qarrijuqood to Daaco-dhowrta. Days later,an army unit from Gudhis came to the area to collect new recruits. They set upa temporary base nearby Daaco-dhowrta. The family sent my sister to warn me toavoid the area and avoid herding the camels. I ran away into the countryside.But they arrested many people among them my sister who came to the bush to warnme. They kept my sister in Fiiq for more than two months and later releasedher. She was raped in the prison by soldiers.[161]In May 2007 troops arrested Aden Mohammed Anshur, thevillage leader (ugaas) of Laasoole,in Shilabo wereda, and took him to the Shilabo military base. Aden MohammedAnshur was a respected Ogaadeeni leader, and had been part of a delegation ofOgaadeeni elders that participated in talks with ONLF leaders in London in 2003. He wasreleased from detention and ordered to raise a pro-government militia, but wentback to Laasoole and did not respond to the order. In early June 2007 the ENDFreturned to Laasoole and executed him, together with a second elder, DuulaneGuuleed Arab, and then burned down the village.[162]The army also uses threats andcoercion to recruit militia members. Villagers reported during the June 2007village burnings around Wardheer that the military had demanded weapons andmilitia volunteers or else threatened to burn down the village.[163]In another instance in mid-July, soldiers confiscated a truck loaded withdesperately needed food for WafdugandYucub in Wardheer wereda, telling the residents that the truck would only bereleased if they provided 100 militia fighters to the ENDF.[164]On August 15, 2007, soldiers came to El-weyne inDanaan wereda (Gode zone) the morning after ONLF forces had been in the villageto buy supplies such as sugar, goats, rice, and tea. The soldiers gathered thevillagers together and ordered them to take up arms against the ONLF.  Ibrahim Omar Asaade, a trader in his 60s,protested, saying "they [ONLF] will kill us if we do that."  A soldier then stabbed Ibrahim Omar Asaade todeath with his bayonet, according to a relative who was present at the time:"One soldier put a bayonet in [Ibrahim Omar Asaade's] kidney. He repeatedlystabbed him several times while the bayonet was still in the rifle."[165]Four other villagers were also killed by the soldiers, including Dahabo Ali andher sister Sirad Ali.[166]The army base in Danaan itself was attacked by ONLF fightersaround April 2007. The morning after the attack, soldiers gathered togetheryoung men from the village, and ordered the men to fight the ONLF. According tothe sister of one of the young men, a group of about 10 of the men refused tofight and were shot dead by the soldiers.[167]Other witnesses told similar stories of how their relativeshad been forcibly recruited by the military to fight the ONLF. One woman toldHuman Rights Watch how in October 2007 the ENDF had forcibly recruited herbrother, Farah Nur Ibrahim, a school teacher from Yucub village in Wardheerwereda, and seven other relatives from the village to go fight the ONLF. Thearmy gave them weapons but no military training, andjust days afterwards her brother and three others were killed in fightingagainst the ONLF: "My brother was among eight men from close relatives who weregiven guns by the army to fight the ONLF. They received the guns just few daysbefore their death. Of the eight, four died while the other four are wounded."[168]"Economic war": Confiscation of Livestock, the Trade Embargo,and Other RestrictionsThe ethnic Somali population of Somali Region consistsmostly of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. Livestock production and tradeare the principal economic activities in the region and are essential to thelivelihoods and survival of the majority of rural inhabitants of Somali Region,as well as for the vibrant trader community in the urban towns.[169]The economy of Somali region and the well-being of thepopulation depend on the movement of persons and goods, both to access grazingand water for the livestock and in order to transport them to local markets.Livestock herders constantly move camp to ensure adequate foraging and waterfor their herds, which in turn are transported to Somaliland and Puntland, bothfor local consumption and export to the GulfStates, the main export market. In return, vitalsupplies such as rice, sugar, flour, and clothes are transported by truck fromHargeysa, Berbera, and other locations in northern and southern Somaliato Somali Region and sold at the local markets. Several important trade routeslink Somali Region with coastal ports in Somalia:a northern trade route via Hargeysa to Berbera and a southern route throughGode to Mogadishu.Additional routes lead to Bossaso and other port cities.Attacking and confiscating livestock as a way of penalizingor controlling ethnic Somali pastoralists is not a new strategy. Human RightsWatch described a similar strategy used by the government of Emperor HaileSelassie to subdue insurgent movements in Somali Region in the 1960s:More serious for the civilian population in the area wasthe government's policy of mounting punitive expeditions, which killed orconfiscated large numbers of animals, depriving the pastoral communities of thebasis for their survival.Military administration remained in the Ogaden after theinsurrection. Most major towns had curfews for at least a year. Ogaden clanleaders documented a number of incidents in May 1964, when 75 people werereported killed by the army, together with more than 14,000 domestic animalskilled or confiscated, and July 1964, when 22 people were killed and over 8,000animals killed or confiscated. This "economic war" against the Ogaden wassupplemented by a policy of encouraging Amhara farmers to settle in the morefertile areas, especially in the Jijiga area. The process of land registrationbecame a vehicle for settler farmers claiming land rights, deprivingpastoralists of use rights. The lack of access to these pastures becamecritical when drought struck in 1973-4.[170]The Ethiopian government adopted a similar strategy ofconfiscating or killing livestock, often in conjunction with efforts toforcibly relocate villagers, as the case study of Labiga illustrates above.When combined with a rigid trade embargo on the conflict-affected zones andrestrictions on movement, the effect on civilians has been disastrous.Effects of the Trade EmbargoFor years the Ethiopiangovernment has intermittently tried to regulate livestock trade from the region.However, following the ONLF attack on Obole in April 2007, the Ethiopiangovernment imposed a total commercial trade embargo on the war-affected area ofSomali Region (Fiiq, Dhagahbur, Gode, Korahe, and Wardheer-theOgaadeeni-inhabited zones), prohibiting all commercial truck movement in theregion and across the border into Somalia,as well as the free movement of livestock by foot. In meetings with UNofficials, the Ethiopian authorities claimed that this embargo was necessary toimpede the flow of arms and other supplies to the ONLF.[171]  The trade embargo effectively shut down thevital trade route between Somaliland and Somalia and the war-affected areas ofSomali Region, and further prevented the mostly pastoralist population frombringing livestock to markets for sale.The trade embargo was rigorously enforced through theconfiscation of trucks and supplies that violated the embargo, as well asoccasional killings of livestock and people who sought to evade it. The armypatrols the main roads in the area and has set up checkpoints at entry pointsinto towns to prevent embargo violations.Within weeks of the April 2007 Obole attack, the armedforces began confiscating commercial vehicles that moved goods intoconflict-affected zones of Somali Region. In May 2007 the last major tradeconvoy left Hargeysa in Somaliland, consistingof 18 trucks stocked with food items and clothing. All 18 trucks were stoppedand confiscated by the army near Dhagahbur, and were taken to the military basein Dhagahbur. At the end of September 2007, four months afterwards, all 18trucks remained confiscated at the military base, according to their owners.[172]The army continued to confiscate goods and trucks moving inand out of the affected region, a tactic that soon forced the commercialtraders to stop their trade, as the risk of losing their goods and vehicles wassimply too high. In early June 2007, businessman Mohammed Abdi Khalif wastransporting goods (sugar, oil, and other food items) from Hargeysa inSomaliland to Aware town in Ogaden when he was stopped by a military patrol 12kilometers before reaching Aware, near the village of Dud Adaad.The patrol accused him of delivering food to the ONLF, and confiscated histruck, using the goods he was transporting for their own consumption withoutcompensation. After keeping the truck for one month at an Awaremilitary base, they released it, emptied of its goods. The loss of an entiretruck of goods, not to mention the truck itself in many cases, is a cripplingloss for small traders.In early September 2007, the army eased up the trade embargoslightly, allowing commercial trucks from Hargeysa, Somaliland, to travel tothe non-conflict affected town of Hartasheik in Somali Region, a longer route,and then proceeding with a military escort (paid for by the truck owners) toDhagahbur.[173]  However, the government continued to restrictmost commercial access to the conflict-affected zones: in mid-September, threecommercial trucks traveling from Hargeysa, Somalilandto Aware were confiscated by the army in Bukudhaba village.[174]While the government's confiscation of commercial trucks andthe restriction of trade were the most visible signs of the trade blockade, itsimpact extended much deeper, threatening civilians in affected areas with ahumanitarian crisis. Vital supplies such as rice, flour, sugar, clothes, andother food items virtually disappeared from the markets in the region, exceptfor small stocks smuggled into the region at great risk. The goods available inthe market doubled or even tripled in price, placing them well beyond the meansof most ordinary citizens, particularly as they could no longer sell theirlivestock because of the same blockade. One trader explained the rise in pricesto Human Rights Watch in September 2007:Before the blockade, the price for a sack of sugar was 220Birr (US$24) [wholesale]. During my last trip, I sold them for 550 Birr ($60).Rice was 200 Birr ($22), now it costs 550 Birr ($60). Maize was 80 Birr ($9),now it is 200 Birr ($22). The farthest you can [smuggle] food is Dhagahbur.Before, I used to transport to Fiiq three or four times per month.[175]An interagency United Nations humanitarian assessmentmission to Somali Region conducted in late August and early September 2007estimated that the trade embargo had reduced the flow of commercial goods by 80to 90 percent (since the assessment included some non-conflict affectedregions, the reduction in conflict affected zones would be even greater). Theassessment mission also estimated that an estimated 60 to 80 percent of thepopulation depended on livestock sales for their income, and had been gravelyaffected by the ban on livestock trade. On average, in the areas visited by theassessment team, food prices had increased by 95 percent since the commercialembargo. The mission found that "food prices have increased so dramaticallythat access is severely constrained for the urban poor….the food availabilityin rural areas is reported far less than in major towns."[176]As of March 2008, many of the restrictions on commercialtraffic described above were still in place. Monthly convoys were reportedlypermitted to travel to the major towns with military escort, but not to therural villages.Restrictions on Movement, Herding, and Access to Water SourcesConcentrating the civilian population in military-controlledurban areas, ordering rural residents to relocate to these urban centers andoften burning their rural homes has been accompanied by severe restrictions onthe movement of the civilian population, goods, and livestock. Theconflict-affected rural areas of Somali Region have effectively been "closed"and put off-limits to the civilian population. Civilians found in these"closed" areas risk being killed or detained, and often have their livestockconfiscated.Although the food situation in the major towns has beenaffected significantly by the trade embargo, the conditions in the "closed"areas where villages have been burned and villagers forced to relocate is muchworse because of the severe restrictions placed on movement. Local residentstold Human Rights Watch that men from the "closed" Lahelow area have been arrested when trying to leave Wardheer townwith food supplies, and that restrictions have reportedly been placed on theamount of water and food that can be taken out of towns.[177]The existence of these restrictions was confirmed by an interagency UNassessment mission that visited the area in late August and September 2007:The team also found that the movement of food from towns tovillages and from one village to another was strictly monitored and controlledby the military in some areas. For instance in Birqod of Dhagahbur wereda, allthe food stocks were registered by the military and checked on a daily basis toensure that food was not leaving the towns. Those interviewed reported that thereason for these restrictions were to ensure that ONLF members did not accessfood.[178]Among those most severely affected by the ban on movementare the pastoralists. Their livestock cannot be relocated to urban areas forlong periods of time, as there is inadequate access to grazing and water inthese locations. However, the livestock herders risk arrest and death, and theconfiscation of their livestock, if they continue to live their pastoralistlifestyle. When they enter towns to sell milk or livestock, they are oftendetained on suspicion of supporting, supplying, or spying for the ONLF. The banon livestock trading to Somaliland hasdeprived them of their income, and contributed to a substantial drop inlivestock prices within the region.[179]One woman who fled the area described the plight of her relatives to HumanRights Watch:The nomads are not allowed to move freely to the areas theywant to go to feed their camels. They can only feed around the towns. It isdifficult for the nomads because the soldiers go on foot, so the nomads can'tsee them coming. If the soldiers see the camel tracks, they will follow themand accuse you of feeding the rebels and they may kill you, or take some camels,or shoot the camels.[180]Human Rights Watch documented a number of cases in whicharmy soldiers apprehended or killed nomadic herders in "closed" rural areas. Inmid-September 2007, as discussed above, the army reportedly killed five youngcamel herders in the Lahelow area of Ogaden. According to the brother of one ofthe victims:My younger brother, Abdulrahman Hassan, was killed withfour other relatives, just in the last five days. They were killed in theLahelow area-every week the soldiers used to conduct sweep operations in thisarea. The soldiers are ordering the people to leave this area with theiranimals, so that there are no animals in the ONLF areas [to feed the ONLFfighters]. Those who refuse are shot dead with their animals if they are foundthere. My brother was 19, he was there with 80 camels.The others were killed in the same area, and all of the camels were taken away.The boys from the other camps [who were killed] had their own camels.[181]In late June 2007, soldiers reportedly killed Abdi AskerMuhumed and his brother Ahmed Asker Muhumed, both in their early 20s, when theywere discovered watering their camels at a water well in Maleyko, southwest ofGarbo. The bodies of the two brothers were left behind by the soldiers, anddiscovered and buried by other pastoralists.[182]Three other herders were killed in the same area in April2007, according to the elderly sister of two of the victims. Ahmed MohammedGedi was found alone by soldiers in the Helo-Dere area, just west of Garbo,looking for a group of stray camels, and was killed: "They shot him in the headwith three bullets. They don't like to see a lone man in the bush, and worse,Ahmed tried to escape from them."[183]According to the sister, four or five days later, Ahmed's brother Dayib MohammedGedi, was looking for the same stray camels in the area between Garbo andSagag, together with an unidentified man he met on the road, and was discoveredby the soldiers. Both men were shot dead and their bodies were found after thearmy moved on.[184]Human Rights Watch received additional credible reports ofsimilar cases of Ethiopian forces shooting livestock-and sometimes the menaccompanying them-dating from December 2007, indicating a continuing pattern ofabuse.[185]Water is equally essential to human and livestock survivaland the Ethiopian government has placed draconian restrictions on water accessin many locations, preventing civilians from accessing vital water sources andshooting camels transporting water in some regions.For example, in late July 2007, the army placed militaryguards at water points throughout Wardheer town, preventing the civilianpopulation from accessing the water sources. Women and children were repeatedlychased away by the soldiers when they attempted to collect water, and thesoldiers also shot dead donkeys brought to the water sources to ferry water. Atthat time, a well owner from Wardheer confirmed that he received orders fromthe military not to allow civilians to use his well, and that soldiers at hiswell were chasing away any civilians who had come to seek water.[186]Another resident reported similar restrictions in Qoriley:We have a well in Qoriley which is surrounded by wire. Thearmy has prohibited us from using it, so you have to sneak in at night. Allthese things have been imposed on us this year. At nighttime, we will try andget some water to store in our houses. But if the soldiers see you are fetchingwater, they can kill you.[187]At the same time, the military began killing andconfiscating camels transporting water from villages around Wardheer, includingan estimated 28 camels transporting water shot outside Ubatale in early July.[188]In some of the villages burned by the ENDF, soldiers also purposefullydestroyed water sources. In August, the army lifted some of the restrictions onwater use for the residents of Wardheer, but kept up a strict ban on access towater for nomads from outside the town.[189]Restrictions on Humanitarian AssistanceDespite longstanding humanitarian needs and a worseninghumanitarian situation, the Ethiopian government has severely restrictedhumanitarian agencies from operating in the conflict-affected areas of SomaliRegion.On July 25, 2007, the Ethiopian authoritiesexpelled the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from Somaliregion, accusing the organization, which has been working in Ethiopia for more than threedecades and operates on the basis of strict neutrality, of "collaborating withthe enemy [ONLF]" and "spreading baseless accusations" against the Ethiopianauthorities.[190]  The ICRC was the only international agencyworking throughout the region and had a large water and sanitation projectconstructing boreholes and wells, conducted livestock management trainings forherders, and confidentially monitored prison conditions and the adherence ofall parties to the laws of war during the conflict, its mandated activities.[191]Aside from the ICRC, only a handful of international andEthiopian humanitarian non-governmental organizations (including Médecins SansFrontières (MSF), Médecins Du Monde, Save the Children, and Action Contre laFaim) were operating in the region, and most faced severe restrictions on theirability to operate effectively as of mid-2007. In September 2007 the Ethiopianauthorities refused two MSF country sections permission on three separateoccasions to enter or move around conflict-affected areas of the region. Anemergency request by MSF-Belgium for 24 to 48-hour access to the war-affectedtown of Fiiq tosupply urgently needed medicines was among the requests that were refused bythe Ethiopian authorities.[192]In late August and early September 2007, the Ethiopianauthorities finally allowed an interagency United Nations humanitarianassessment mission access to some of the conflict-affected areas to investigatehumanitarian conditions. In its report, which was the subject of intensenegotiations between the UN and the Ethiopian government before its release,the UN assessment team confirmed the growing humanitarian needs. The reportalso stated that the UN team "encountered a pervasive fear for individualsafety and security among the population visited," and that "the human rightssituation and protection situation for the civilian population in the areas ofmilitary operation is alarming and requires urgent attention."[193]Human Rights Watch received credible reports that Ethiopiansecurity officials severely threatened several Ethiopian nationals working forthe United Nations on the assessment mission, accusing them of links to theONLF and threatening their families.After an itinerary for the mission was agreed upon followingtwo days of negotiations in the regional capital Jijiga, advance parties ofEthiopian officials were sent to the areas to be visited, carefully preparinglocal elders for the meetings and threatening them and local residents withserious consequences if they made unauthorized statements to the mission. Anumber of prominent individuals were arrested prior to the UN mission'sarrival, including Suldan Fowsi Mohamed Ali and Ahmed Mohamed Tarah, prominentclan elders who had participated in efforts to negotiate between the Ethiopiangovernment and the ONLF.[194]Suldan Fowsi remains in detention as of May 2008 (see below). On at least oneoccasion during the UN mission, dozens of residents were arrested after meetingwith the UN assessment team in Dhagahbur, and apparently released the next dayafter the UN team protested.[195]Following the UN mission, theEthiopian government agreed to an expanded UN presence in Somali Region, a positivestep, and the UN soon opened two regional sub-offices. In early November, afterfurther negotiations with the UN and under mounting fears of a humanitariancrisis, the Ethiopian authorities also permitted a dozen or so humanitariannon-governmental organizations to begin or resume programs in Somali Region.[196]  Yet humanitarian agencies remained subject tosevere limitations on their access to vulnerable populations, and not justphysical restrictions. They are constantly threatened by Ethiopian governmentefforts to silence any publicity-much less criticism-on conditions in theregion, particularly regarding human rights abuses or a potential humanitariancrisis. Even the collection of essential medical and nutritional data to assesshumanitarian needs is considered a political exercise by the government, whichuses its Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency (DPPA) to "coordinate"relief, especially the distribution of food aid.In December 2007 two staff working for Save the Children-UK(SCF-UK) were expelled on accusations of "diverting food aid to rebels," notlong after the organization published a report indicating that malnutritionlevels among children were rising.[197] One aid worker described the atmosphere inSomali Region as "an ambiance of fear," affecting both the residents of theregion as well as the aid workers trying to provide services. Many communities areafraid even to attend food distributions because of fear of the military, and everyone,including aid workers, is afraid to voice even basic concerns over conditionsdue to fear of arrest or harassment.[198]Journalists who have visited the region, usually ongovernment-agreed visits, have also noted the pervasive culture of fear amongcivilians, including aid workers.[199]Since December 2007, at least 25 aid workers, including some internationalstaff, have been detained without charge for varying periods of time.[200]As of May 2008 there were more organizations active inSomali Region than a year earlier, with the significant exception of theInternational Committee of the Red Cross, which has not resumed activities.However, the presence of a larger number of aid organizations alone is by nomeans an accurate or significant indicator of progress, since there are seriousquestions over whether aid-and specifically food aid-is reaching the people whomost need it.  There are concerns atevery stage: from inadequate independent assessment of needs to the manner of distributionof food aid to the lack of post-distribution monitoring to ensure that the foodis not being diverted.Independent and impartial assessments of humanitarian needsin the conflict-affected zones remain extremely difficult due to officialrestrictions. Independent nutritional assessments are an essential tool todetermine malnutrition rates and guide response-but are rendered almostimpossible due to physical obstruction of access to all areas (specificallyareas under ONLF control), threats to individuals participating in the surveys,or repression of the data.Even where the food needs are clear, there are seriousconcerns about the degree to which food aid actually reaches the mostvulnerable groups given widespread reports of military control and diversion offood aid, for instance to their militia partners, and the substandardindependent monitoring of food distribution.In March 2008 one aid worker noted concerns that the government'smanipulation of food amounted to the use of food as a "weapon of war" andrecommended that management of the relief food operation should be immediatelygiven to the UN's World Food Program, which currently only supports the DPPA.[201]While Human Rights Watch was unable to fully investigate these allegations,there is sufficient evidence of grave concerns in the delivery of food aid towarrant an independent audit and evaluation of the humanitarian response inSomali Region, and donors should insist on such a step.The situation is deteriorating, in part due to the worseningdrought, but this factor should not obscure the significant and ongoing humanrights abuses that are creating the conditions for humanitarian crisis. Theseare the excessive trade restrictions, the unnecessary restrictions on movementof individuals and livestock and access to water and grazing, the continuingobstruction of genuine humanitarian space, and the pervasive, systematic abusesthat are besieging the civilian population in the conflict-affected zones. Eventhe most innocuous humanitarian analysis cannot ignore the way thesefundamental factors are exacerbating the situation.[202]Humanitarian response-even at its best-is not a substitute for the most urgentneed: protection.The Failure of Judicial Protection and theInstitutionalization of Collective PunishmentEnforcing the LawLegal protections are routinely flouted in Somali Region,even where the regional judiciary attempts to enforce the rights of those whohave been detained or mistreated. While there are a range of factorscontributing to the lack of independence and enforcement power of thejudiciary, including corruption and insufficient capacity, the most significantand damaging reason remains the supremacy of the security forces, particularlythe federal security forces and their regional allies within theadministration.  "It's ridiculous to saythere's an independent judiciary in our region," a former regional judge toldHuman Rights Watch. "All of the region is underemergency rule. The military has the last word on all matters, whetheradministrative or humanitarian."[203]Even regional government officials have little or no powerto enforce the law or protect themselves from abuses by federal securityforces. A former government employee detained in 2004 and again in 2005 aftertrying to stand as an independent candidate for the regional parliament, toldHuman Rights Watch how he had been unable to secure his legal rights while inmilitary detention:In [March 2005], I was detained from work and taken to oneof the [military bases] in [place withheld]. According to the constitution, aperson cannot be held for more than 48 hours without being charged. When I wasdetained for over two months, I wrote a letter to my colleagues at the regionaladministration, asking them to charge me or to release me. The head of thepolice in [place withheld] told me that he received my letter but would notpass it on to the administration.[204]A judicial official expressed deep frustration at the lackof independence of the courts and regional institutions, noting that even whenthe regional courts issued release orders, they were often ignored. He said,"If [the federal government] followed the law it would be good, but even thelaw they've created is not being followed."[205]Another former judge from Somali Region told Human RightsWatch he ordered the release of a group of detainees arbitrarily accused ofbeing ONLF supporters, only to find himself detainedon the orders of a high-ranking regional official. He explained how accusationsof ONLF involvement were frequently used to settle political power struggles:Whenever the ONLF carried out operations, the governmentdoesn't differentiate between the ONLF and civilians [in its response]. Theydon't do this deliberately, they are just confused asto who is who. So, the ONLF issue is exploited for political means. Someoneidentifies others as ONLF, and those persons get arrested, so accusing peopleof being ONLF becomes a way to settle disputes.[206]While the vast majority of detainees appear to be arrestedfor perceived connection to the ONLF or because of the use of this allegationto settle scores, there are several other explanations given for some of thenumerous arbitrary arrests and prolonged detentions without charge in SomaliRegion. Among these is the justice system's general lack of capacity to handlethe scale of cases.Even where detainees have beencharged with a criminal offense, an additional constraint on their ever beingbrought to court is the legal jurisdiction over "security" cases and lack ofcapacity within the police and judicial systems, which results in a seriousbacklog in the judicial review of detention cases. According to a former judge,until three years ago the regional courts were able to exercise jurisdictionover security cases, but this changed with a federal proclamation thatestablished federal high courts in a number of states, including Somali Region.[207]  However the only federal high court in thevicinity of Somali Region is in Dire Dawa and it is difficult, if notimpossible, for many detainees to travel there, due to lack of means, insecurity,and other reasons. "There is no budget for witnesses or for investigationsupport, for instance for transporting witnesses to court," a governmentofficial told Human Rights Watch. The lack of judicial capacity is echoed inthe police force, where many police lack training in conducting investigationsand, as a former member of the judiciary said to Human Rights Watch, "[The]police can't even finalize a file for prosecution."[208]While lack of capacity mayindeed be a factor delaying the judicial process for some detainees, it is nobarrier in politically motivated cases. Detentions and manipulation of judicialprocesses are used to further personal rivalries, score-settling andrevenge.  In a case that exemplifies the absenceof judicial independence, Jijiga's regional court on May 12, 2008 sentenced two high profiledefendents, Suldan Fowsi Mohammed Ali and Ibrahim Haad, to 22 and 16 years inprison respectively, despite the court's lack of jurisdiction over securitycases.[209]Suldan Fowsi, a traditional elder who helped negotiate with the ONLF for therelease of the Chinese oil workers in April 2007, was arrested on August 28,2007 prior to the UN assessment mission's arrival (see above). Initially he washeld in incommunicado detention in one of Jijiga'smilitary camps, but was then transferred to "Jail Ogaden" in October 2007,where he has since been detained. In May 2008 he was reportedly charged withresponsibility for the May 2007 grenade attacks in Dhagahbur and Jijiga,although Human Rights Watch has not been able to obtain the precise details ofthe charges against him.[210]Credible sources told Human Rights Watch that the federalcourt in Dire Dawa had requested that the case be transferred several times,but members of the regional administration refused.[211]Aside from jurisdictional questions, the trial appears to have fallen wellshort of the due process guarantees required by Ethiopian and internationallaw. Among other concerns, Suldan Fowsi had no legal counsel and was denied theopportunity to defend himself.[212]Corruption is also a factor atthe lower wereda and kebele administrative levels. According to a former judge,regional officials apparently receive a budget allocation based on the numbersof prisoners, creating an incentive for higher numbers of detainees.[213]Detainees also routinely report having to pay bribes of 1,000 to 5,000Ethiopian Birr (about US$110 to $550 in early 2008) to police and military fortheir release, creating a substantial incentive for security forces to keep individualsin detention.[214]Authorizing Collective PunishmentIn August 2007 the regionalparliament of Somali Regional State unanimously endorsed two decisions that arenot only discriminatory on their face, violating Ethiopian and internationalhuman rights law, but  amount toinstitutionalized collective punishment of communities perceived to support orsympathize with the ONLF.One law penalizes families and clans of ONLF members andrequires that they pay compensation for the lives of any individuals killed bythe ONLF:…if any person who is a member of anti-peace ONLF killsanother person, his clan or immediate family will be held responsible to paycompensation for the loss of life. On the other hand if the dead is an ONLFmember, no compensation will be paid to his family; and no one could be heldresponsible for his death.[215]There is a long tradition of clan compensation (diya or "blood money," usually in theform of livestock) for violations of Somali customary law, known as xeer. The parliamentary decision passedby the regional parliament manipulates the element of communal responsibilityinvolved in the xeer system. Itpenalizes entire communities for the actions of some individual members,regardless of whether the families or sub-clans have any control over thoseindividuals.As this report has described, when there is any suspicion ofeven the vaguest connection to the ONLF, individuals in Somali Region arealready at great risk of being subjected to serious human rights violations,including extrajudicial executions, rape, torture, and arbitrary detention. Theparliamentary provision effectively formalizes the economic attacks andpunishment of communities, and the additional language noting that ONLFmembers' deaths will not be compensated reinforces the understanding that theprovision is not about compensation-it is about punishment.The decision also subverts the xeer because ordinarily xeercases proceed according to a process that includes investigation by theaggrieved party, the mediation or arbitration of a dispute by respected elderswho essentially act as judges, and a procedure wherebypleas of guilt and innocence and examination of the evidence take place. Theparliamentary decision, in contrast, can easily be used to target individuals,families, and communities on personal or political grounds; indeed, in thecourse of this research Human Rights Watch heard many descriptions of the waysin which allegations of ONLF connections are already manipulated in this way.The second parliamentary decision provides for thesuspension of all state budget allocation to administrative areas where theONLF is active. It states:In the allocation of the capital budget, no budget shouldbe allocated for the districts where the anti-peace elements [ONLF] operate.For districts where the anti-peace elements do not operate, their budget shouldimmediately be released and should be higher than the former, so that theformer districts follow their example.Penalizing whole districts in this manner is blatantlydiscriminatory. The decision was implemented against certain weredas inlate-2007, but it is unclear whether it continues to be implemented. The veryexistence of such legislation indicates that the intent of key regional andfederal policymakers is to actively and comprehensively impose collectivepunishment on communities in a manner that violates fundamental legal norms.Part 3: Abusesby the Ogaden National Liberation FrontTheOgaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) has been responsible for seriousabuses, including abductions, beatings, and summary executions of civilians intheir custody, including government officials and individuals suspected ofsupporting the government.While its attacksare largely directed at the Ethiopian armed forces, it has at times conductedattacks against civilian areas and used landmines in a manner thatindiscriminately harmed civilians. The ONLF also has threatened attacks oncivilian commercial enterprises and imposed "taxes" on commercial trucks andconvoys moving through rural areas under their control. Individuals who commitserious laws of war violations are responsible for war crimes.SummaryExecutions and Attacks on Civilians by the ONLFIn early 2007 theONLF, capitalizing on the Ethiopian military's redeployment of troops toSomalia, attacked several major towns including Garbo (in Garbo wereda, Fiiqzone) and Gunagada (southeast of Dhagabur town, in Dhagahbur zone), followed bythe even larger offensive on the Chinese-run oil installation near Obole town,west of Dhagahbur town. During and following these attacks, ONLF rebels beatand summarily executed persons in their custody.The ONLF killed 25people, including the local head of security, Sa'ad Aw Siyad, when it attackedGunagada on January 19, 2007.They also abducted a number of officials. The police commissioner, Bedel Abdi Nor, and a regional member of parliament who was badlywounded, Mohammed Abdulahi Wafer, were later executed. Another five detaineeswere subsequently released.[216]Garbo was alsoattacked in January 2007. At the time it was defended only by local militias,not Ethiopian military forces. The ONLF fighters demanded that the militia andlocal police hand over their weapons, but this demand was refused and localelders tried to mediate. The ONLF then attacked the police station, killingfive local police officers and militia members before taking control andlooting the weaponry. The ONLF fighters then departed with several abductedcivilians, whom they later released.[217]On April 24, 2007, the ONLFattacked the oil exploration facilities of the Chinese company, ZhongyuanPetroleum Exploration Bureau, a few kilometers from Obole town in Dhaghaburzone.[218] As the oil facilities were a civilianenterprise, the attack violated the international humanitarian law againsttargeting civilian objects. It sparked the Ethiopian government's stepped-upcounter-offensive.Hundreds of ONLFfighters attacked the oil installation before dawn, quickly overpowering the 50or so Ethiopian army troops protecting the site during a 30-minute gunbattle.After routing the soldiers, the ONLF fighters entered the Obole oilinstallation, willfully killing approximately 65 Ethiopian nationals, most ofthem laborers, and nine Chinese technicians.Eyewitnessesdescribed to Human Rights Watch the numerous summary executions of civilians.Many of the Ethiopian workers and Chinese technicians were shot at point-blankrange, when the ONLF fighters entered accommodation tents and found peopletrying to hide on the ground. Some were lined up outside their quarters andsummarily executed. The victims included the camp nurse and three female cooks.[219] A survivor said, "I thought they werekidnapping us when they took us out of the tent. But they even shot the Somaliemployees." Some people were shot several times and bled to death.[220]On the same day,the ONLF also attacked the nearby villageof Sandhore, where aprominent local businessman, Ibrahim Haad, ran a sizeable farm. Ibrahim Haadreportedly provided militiamen for government counter-insurgency operations andused to have close relations with the regional security bureau. Eighteen peoplewere killed during the attack, including a school teacher, a Koran teachernamed Moalim Hassan, and several other civilians.[221] While it is unclear how many of them werekilled in crossfire, some of those killed, including the administrator of thefarm, were summarily executed by the insurgents.[222]On April 29 theONLF released seven Chinese oil workers and two Ethiopian workers it hadabducted from the Obole oil field, although Human Rights Watch has receivedreliable reports that a third Ethiopian worker kidnapped by the ONLF, an ethnicSomali, was not released by the ONLF and is feared dead.[223]The ONLF latertried to justify the attack by claiming that senior government officials werefinancially involved in the Obole oil exploration, and that civilians had beenforced off their land by the exploration project.[224] As a matter of international law, suchjustifications are irrelevant-the installation was not a valid military target.On August 7, 2007,the ONLF issued a statement warning all oil companies to stop operating in theOgaden or risk attack from the ONLF.[225]OnMay 28, 2007, two simultaneous grenade attacks by unknown assailants took placeduring annual celebrations to mark the downfall of Mengistu's Derg government (ginbot haya in Amharic, literally 20thof the month ginbot), considered apro-government event by many in Somali Region. In Dhagahbur town, the heartlandof the Ogaadeeni clan, three grenades were thrown into the crowd, one explodedkilling four people instantly and wounding more than 60 others. Two morepeople, a 17-year-old student and a woman, died from their injuries on the wayto the hospital.[226]Ataround the same time as the Dhagahbur grenade attack, unknown assailants threwthree grenades into a similar celebration at the soccer stadium in Jijiga,which was being attended by the regional president, Abdullahi Hassan "Lugbuur."  At least 11 people were killed in the attack,including a local journalist, and the regional president was wounded. Some ofthose killed and injured may have been shot by Ethiopian soldiers responding tothe attack or were crushed by the panicking crowd.[227]The ONLF's exiledspokesperson in Londondenied responsibility for the May28, 2007 grenade attacks. Some observers have noted that the ONLFhas not been known to bomb crowded sites, a tactic in the past associated withsuch groups as al-Itihaad, which claimed responsibility for a series of deadlybombings and grenade attacks, including in Addis Ababa, in 1995 and 1996. Otherssuggested that the targeting of the regional president may have been linked todivisions within the regional government. No publicly-available governmentinvestigation to date has pinpointed responsibility for these attacks.TheONLF has also summarily executed suspected government collaborators orindividuals viewed as supporting the government, according to eyewitnessaccounts. In February 2007, ONLF forces allegedly executed 25-year-old HodanGahnug of Maracato village, south of Kabridahar town in Korahe zone. Accordingto a credible source, the ONLF "felt she was propagating against them withinthe community….They took her out of Maracato and shot her dead." Human RightsWatch was told that Gahnug's brother and two other young men had been killed bythe ONLF and she "was against the ONLF because she was angered by the killingof her brother."[228]Inanother case documented by Human Rights Watch, ONLF fighters detained fouryoung men from Dayr village in August 2007, accusing them of collaborating withthe Ethiopian army. The bodies of the four men were later found executedoutside the village. The four victims included Yusri Dakharre and Weli Aden.The willful killing of anyone in custody is a violation of the laws of armedconflict. These cases also illustrate the degree of pressure rural communitiescome under to cooperate with the ONLF.Attacks onNon-Ogaadeeni Clans and PropertyThe ONLF hasengaged in clan-based armed clashes, sometimes supporting fellow Ogaadeenicivilians from related sub-clans in disputes over land or other resources. Someof these clashes have resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries,particularly in the conflict between certain Ogaadeeni subclans and theShekash/Sheikahl clan, and between Ogaadeeni and Isaaq.Tensions betweencertain Ogaadeeni sub-clans and Isaaq clan members are longstanding. HumanRights Watch received reports that ONLF forces haveregularly targeted traders belonging to the rival Isaaq clan. The ONLF viewssome Isaaq, including the authorities in Somaliland,as collaborating with the Ethiopian army and transporting food aid ascontractors of the Ethiopian government and international relief agencies.These trucks are often owned by Isaaq businessmen based in Dire Dawa andHargeysa.Illustrating thistension, in 2004 the ONLF and Ogaadeeni civilians burned and destroyed asignificant number of commercial trucks belonging to Isaaq businessmen in adispute, apparently after the authorities in Somalilanddetained some Ogaadeeni youths. "We tried everything to get the boys released.Finally we took the decision to burn their trade vehicles," a 45-year-old mantold Human Rights Watch. "We put wood on them and set on fire. It happened inKabridahar, Wardheer, Dhagahbur and Fiiq. The message to target Isaaq truckswas well spread throughout Ogaden."[229]Part 4: ApplicableLegal StandardsUnder internationallaw, the conflict between Ethiopiaand the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) in the eastern Somali Region isa non-international (internal) armed conflict in which both parties are boundby international humanitarian law (the laws of war). Ethiopian state forces-theEthiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) and pro-government militias-and theONLF are obligated to observe article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventionsof 1949 ("common article 3"), the Second Additional Protocol of 1977 to theGeneva Conventions (Protocol II), applicable to non-international armedconflicts, and relevant customary international law. Ethiopia is a party to the 1949Geneva Conventions and both Protocol II.[230]Internationalhumanitarian law forbids deliberately harming civilians and other persons nolonger taking part in the hostilities, including wounded or capturedcombatants. It also provides rules on the conduct of hostilities to minimizeunnecessary suffering.International humanrights law is also applicable, including the International Covenant on Civiland Political Rights (ICCPR)[231], the Convention against Torture and OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment[232], and the African Charter on Human andPeoples' Rights.[233]Ethiopia has incorporated many ofthe provisions of the most important human rights treaties in its constitutionand other relevant national legislation.[234] These provisions prohibit violations of theright to life, torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitraryarrest and detention, and unfair trials. They also provide for the rights to theprotection of the home and family, and specific protection of children in timesof armed conflict.[235]In the context ofhostilities occurring as part of armed conflict, international humanitarianlaw, as the lex specialis orspecialized law, takes precedence but does not replace human rights law.Persons under the control of government or armed opposition forces in aninternal armed conflict must, in all cases, be treated in accordance withinternational humanitarian law, which incorporates important human rightsstandards.[236]Individuals may beheld criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian andhuman rights law. Serious violations of international humanitarian law are warcrimes. Human rights abuses committed as part of a widespread or systematicattack against any civilian population are crimes against humanity.SummaryExecutions and Other Mistreatment of Persons in CustodySummary orextrajudicial executions and the mistreatment of detained persons are illegalunder any circumstances according to both international humanitarian and humanrights law. Common article 3 prohibits "at any time and in any placewhatsoever" with respect to civilians and captured combatants:(a) Violence tolife and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, crueltreatment, and torture;(b) Taking ofhostages;(c) Outrages uponpersonal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;(d) The passing ofsentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronouncedby a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees whichare recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.Similar fundamentalguarantees are provided under Protocol II.[237]International humanrights laws prohibit the arbitrary deprivation of life and, at all times,torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.[238]Rape andOther Sexual ViolenceRapeand other forms of sexual violence that is committed in a non-internationalarmed conflict violate international humanitarian and human rights law.International humanitarian law prohibits both states and non-state armed groupsfrom committing rape and other forms of sexual violence.[239]International humanrights law binding on Ethiopiaalso contains protections from rape and sexual assault as forms of torture andother ill-treatment, and as discrimination based on sex.[240]Attacks onCivilians and Civilian ObjectsA fundamentalprinciple of international humanitarian law is that parties to a conflict mustdistinguish between combatants and civilians, and may not deliberately targetcivilians or civilian objects. Protocol II states that "thecivilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protectionagainst the dangers arising from military operations." They are not tobe the object of attack, and all acts or threats ofviolence with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilianpopulation are prohibited.[241] Customary international humanitarian lawprohibits attacks directed against civilian objects, such as homes and placesof worship.[242]Protocol II specifically bans attacks, destruction, or removal ofobjects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population includingfood-stuffs, agricultural areas, crops, livestock, drinking water installationsand supplies, and irrigation works.[243] Pillage (or plunder) – the forcible takingof private property – is also prohibited.[244]ForcedDisplacementThe forceddisplacement of civilians for war-related reasons is forbidden. Civilians mayonly be displaced for their security or imperative military reasons. ProtocolII states:The displacementof the civilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to theconflict unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative militaryreasons so demand. Should such displacements have to be carried out, allpossible measures shall be taken in order that the civilian population may bereceived under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety andnutrition.[245]The term"imperative military reasons" usually refers to evacuation because of imminentmilitary operations. Such evacuation assumes proper procedures for notificationand evacuation, and proper means of transport to a safe place. It does notallow for a military attack on a civilian population or civilian property toforce the displacement, as civilians are not legitimate military objectivesunder international humanitarian law.The provisionalmeasure of evacuation is appropriate if an area is in danger as a result ofmilitary operations or is liable to be subjected to attack. Evacuation may alsobe permitted when the presence of civilians in an area hampers militaryoperations. The prompt return of the evacuees to their homes is required assoon as hostilities in the area have ceased. The evacuating authority bears theburden of proving that its forcible relocation conforms to these conditions.Displacement ordetention of civilians solely to deny a support base to the enemy cannot beconsidered to promote the security of the civilians. This also is not justifiedas "imperative military reasons," which require "the most meticulous assessmentof circumstances" to avoid abuse.[246] As explained by the authoritative ICRCCommentary:Clearly,imperative military reasons cannot be justified by political motives. Forexample, it would be prohibited to move a population in order to exercise moreeffective control over a dissident ethnic group.[247]Similarlyprohibited is the mass relocation or displacement of civilians for the purposeof removing an ethnic group deemed friendly to an armed opposition group.Even in instanceswhere the Ethiopian government is able to show that specific displacements inSomali Region were necessary and lawful under international humanitarian law,it still has the independent obligation to take "all possible measures" toreceive the displaced civilian population "under satisfactory conditions ofshelter, hygiene, health, safety, and nutrition."[248]CollectivePunishment and ReprisalsCollectivepunishments are prohibited under international humanitarian law in allcircumstances.[249] The prohibition on collective punishmentsapplies to criminal sanctions against persons for actions for which they do notbear individual criminal responsibility, but also to "all sanctions andharassment of any sort, administrative, by police action or otherwise."[250]Belligerentreprisals are acts that would otherwise be unlawful acts of war but, when usedas an enforcement measure in reaction to the unlawful acts of an adversary may,in exceptional cases, be permitted. Although customary international law doespermit a very narrow category of belligerent reprisals in international armed conflicts,[251] parties to non-international armedconflicts, such as the conflict in Somali Region, do not have the right toresort to belligerent reprisals.[252]Reprisals andcollective punishment violate international humanitarian law prohibitionsagainst the mistreatment of civilians and captured combatants. Common article 3to the Geneva Conventions prohibits in all circumstances acts including murder,mutilation, cruel, humiliating and degrading treatment, and torture againstcivilians and other persons no longer taking part in the hostilities. Article 4of Protocol II also sets out the fundamental guarantees of humane treatment,which explicitly includes a prohibition on collective punishments, acts ofterrorism, and pillage. Commentaries of the International Committee of the RedCross on Protocol II and customary international law make clear that thesearticles leave no room for reprisals in non-international armed conflict.[253]IndividualCriminal ResponsibilityWar CrimesWithrespect to individual responsibility, serious violations of internationalhumanitarian law, including the mistreatment of persons in custody anddeliberate attacks on civilians and civilian property, when committed withcriminal intent amount to war crimes. Criminal intent requirespurposeful or reckless action. Individuals may also be held criminally liablefor attempting to commit a war crime, as well as assisting in, facilitating,aiding or abetting a war crime. Responsibility may also fall on personsordering, planning, or instigating the commission of a war crime.[254] Commanders and civilian leaders may beprosecuted for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility when they knewor should have known about the commission of war crimes and took insufficientmeasures to prevent them or punish those responsible.[255]Under internationallaw, Ethiopiahas an obligation to investigate alleged war crimes by their nationals,including members of their armed forces, and prosecute those responsible forwar crimes.[256]Crimesagainst HumanityThe Ethiopian armedforces have committed numerous acts of murder, torture, rape, and forciblepopulation transfers in the course of widespread, and what appearsto be, systematic attacks against the Somali civilian population inSomali Region. As such, Human Rights Watch believes that these attacks amountto crimes against humanity under international law.Crimes againsthumanity were first codified in the charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945.The purpose was to prohibit crimes "which either by their magnitude andsavagery or by their large number or by the fact that a similar pattern wasapplied…endangered the international community or shocked the conscience ofmankind."[257] Since then, the concept has beenincorporated into a number of international treaties and the statutes ofinternational criminal tribunals, including the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court.[258] The definition of crimes against humanityvaries slightly by treaty, but as a matter of customary international law theterm "crimes against humanity" includes a range of serious human rights abusescommitted as part of a widespread or systematic attack by a government ororganization against a civilian population.[259] Murder, torture, rape, and forciblepopulation transfers all fall within the range of acts that can qualify ascrimes against humanity.[260]Unlike war crimes,crimes against humanity may be committed in times of peace or in periods ofunrest that do not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Crimes againsthumanity include only abuses that take place as part of an attack against acivilian population. So long as the targeted population is of a predominantlycivilian nature, the presence of some combatants does not alter itsclassification as a "civilian population" as a matter of law.[261] Rather, it is necessary only that thecivilian population be the primary object of the attack.[262] Thus, abuses by the Ethiopian armed forcesdirected against civilians even during the course of military operationsagainst villages in Somali Region can fall under the definition of crimesagainst humanity.The attack againsta civilian population underlying the commission of crimes against humanity mustbe widespread or systematic. It need not be both.[263] "Widespread" refers to the scale of theacts or number of victims.[264]Human Rights Watch considers the numerous acts of murder, torture, rape,and forced displacement by ENDF soldiers against the civilian population inSomali Region to be "widespread." Human Rights Watch received reports of atleast 87 burnings and forced displacements of villages, many of which involvedextrajudicial killings, torture, and rape across numerous areas of SomaliRegion. Although there are no reliable estimates of the total number of peopleaffected by these attacks, Human Rights Watch's research alone indicates thatat a conservative estimate, at least 150 people have been unlawfully killed,hundreds unlawfully detained and mistreated, and tens of thousands of peoplehave been forcibly displaced since early 2007 alone, estimates that are farfrom comprehensive.A "systematic"attack indicates "a pattern or methodical plan."[265] International courts have considered towhat extent a systematic attack requires a policy or plan. For instance, such aplan need not be adopted formally as a policy of the state.[266] Human Rights Watch cannot determineconclusively whether or not the serious abuses committed by the Ethiopian armedforces in Somali Region have been systematic. Nonetheless, the similarity ofmany of the attacks on the villages and towns in 2007 documented by HumanRights Watch makes a strong case that there is a pattern to the attacks. Therepeated forced relocations and village burnings, with their attendantkillings, torture, and rapes, do not indicate sporadic and unconnected events.[267] Furthermore, the intensified campaign ofgovernment attacks from June through August 2007, combined with thesimultaneous measures taken by the federal and regional governments, such asthe imposition of commercial and trade blockades, increased restrictions onhumanitarian access and assistance, and the discriminatory measures passed bythe regional government, all appear to be part of a broader policy ofdeliberately punishing communities perceived to be linked to the ONLF.Lastly, forindividuals to be found culpable for crimes against humanity requires theirhaving the relevant knowledge of the crime.[268] That is, perpetrators must be aware thattheir actions formed part of the widespread or systematic attack against thecivilian population.[269] While perpetrators need not be identifiedwith a policy or plan underlying crimes against humanity, they must at leasthave knowingly taken the risk of participating in the policy or plan.[270] An investigation into crimes againsthumanity in Somali Region would have to address this element of the crime.The Ethiopiangovernment has a legal obligation to prosecute and punish military and civilianofficials responsible for the commission of crimes against humanity.[271]Individuals accused of crimes against humanity cannot avail themselvesof the defense of following superior orders nor benefit from statutes of limitation.Because crimes against humanity are considered crimes of universaljurisdiction, all states are responsible for bringing to justice those whocommit crimes against humanity. There is an emerging trend in internationaljurisprudence and standard setting that persons responsible for crimes againsthumanity, as well as other serious violations of human rights, should not begranted amnesty.Part 5: Responses to Allegations of Human Rights ViolationsDespite mountingevidence of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarianlaw committed by Ethiopian security forces in Somali Region, the internationalresponse to the situation has focused mainly on increasing humanitarianassistance, but neglected to address the systematic abuses that are the corecause of the deteriorating situation.The EthiopianGovernment has simply denied evidence of abuses and attempted to preventinformation leaving the area. In the words of Ethiopian Prime Minister MelesZenawi:We are supposed tohave burned villages. I can tell you, not a single village, and as far as Iknow not a single hut has been burned. We have been accused of dislocatingthousands of people from their villages and keeping them in camps. Nobody hascome up with a shred of evidence. Nobody.[272]TheEthiopian Government's ResponseThe Ethiopian government issensitive to criticism of its human rights record. However, rather thanaddressing allegations with concern, investigations, and efforts to improveaccountability, the federal government's principal response to allegations ofabuses in Somali Region has been to suppress independent access, investigation,and reporting of the situation. It has done so through direct methods-such asdetaining international journalists, aid workers, and victims of abuses-and ithas done so indirectly, by creating a climate of intense fear that discouragesEthiopians and international observers from speaking about what they experienceor witness. In the words of one anonymous letter slipped to an internationalvisitor to Somali Region:Once upon a time, a lion came to a village as a guest. Thelion said that he doesn't want any meat but would like milk instead. Thevillagers prepared the milk but then the big question of who will deliver [it]came up. What I mean is we have a lot of information to tell you, but we can't.Because you will [leave] tomorrow and we will be killed.We do not want to be killed.[273]The government has also reacted to any public reporting withvehement denials and claims that reports of abuses are fabrications. Followinga July 2007 Human Rights Watch press release warning of serious abuses, theEthiopian Ministry of Information stated that there were "no attacks byEthiopian troops on civilians and homes."[274]Following the expulsion of the ICRC and MSF's public appeals for access torespond to the escalating humanitarian needs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairsclaimed MSF was "exaggerating the situation" and denied "blocking any NGO" fromthe region.[275]Following media reports of forced recruitment of civilians for thepro-government militia, including staff employed by internationally-fundedprojects in Somali Region, the Ministry of Information promptly denied any suchpractice.[276]To date, according to all information available to HumanRights Watch, there have been no efforts by the federal or regional governmentto investigate, prosecute, or end the patterns of abuses described in thisreport. Acknowledging that there have been serious abuses, and cooperating inefforts to fully investigate and prosecute the crimes would be an importantfirst step to improving the human rights situation in Somali Region. It wouldalso be an important way to rebuild trust with communities whose confidence inthe government has been shattered by years of systematic abuse.The crimes described above are far too systematic andwidespread to be considered the acts of rogue commanders. On the contrary, theavailable information indicates that specific policies were chosen todeliberately terrorize the civilian population. As described above, policies offorced relocation and economic punishment of ethnic Somali pastoralists are oldstrategies that the current EPRDF government seems to have simply recycled.Further investigation is required to establish whether thepatterns of killings, rape, and torture by the ENDF are specifically ordered atthe highest levels. Irrespective of whether troops are explicitly commanded tocommit these crimes, the fact that they are pervasive and often involveofficers or officials in command, indicates that they are widely known andaccepted as appropriate behavior. The laws of war do not only prohibit militaryand civilian leaders from ordering troops to commit such crimes; they alsoplace a positive responsibility on commanders and civilian leaders with commandauthority to prevent and stop crimes that they know about, or should have knownabout.A former ENDF soldier confirmed to Human Rights Watch thateven if there is no explicit ENDF policy specifically ordering troops to abusecivilians, the pretext that civilians are ONLF supporters, whether true or notand regardless of evidence, is sufficient to justify any abuse with fullimpunity. He said:Soldiers are not given orders to rape in town, bush and indetentions. But they are told the people they are fighting are the enemy who have been mislead and [are] stubborn. If theykill, the commander asks who was the person killed. The soldier would need toclassify the victim as an ONLF member/supporter or other enemy, for instance.The commander registers the death as such [ONLF] without any further questions.If the soldier rapes, the commander does not ask [questions]. The soldier hasbeen told, for instance, that people from Zone 5 are difficult, stubborn,extreme Islamists who do not agree with the government; that the land belongsto Ethiopiaand it is compulsory for everybody to follow the rule.[277]The International Response: A Wider SilenceInternational policymakers have increasingly taken a "see noevil, hear no evil, speak no evil" approach to Ethiopia. Over the past threeyears, the sharpest international condemnations of Ethiopian human rightsabuses came in the wake of the May 2005 elections. After security forces killedscores of demonstrators protesting the election results, the World Bank,European Union, United Kingdom, and several other donors suspended directbudget support to the federal government, but soon resumed the aid flows viaother channels, such as through regional governments.[278]Almost three years after the elections, internationalcriticism has dissipated although there has been little effort by the Ethiopiangovernment to account for the serious abuses documented during thepost-election violence or in the context of various security operations it hasmounted in different regions.[279]While the EPRDF government routinely rejects reportscritical of its human rights record, particularly where the ENDF or otherfederal security forces are implicated, it has occasionally responded to them.For instance after the international criticism of post-election violence in2005, the government established a national inquiry into the post-electionviolence that concluded that 193 people were killed by Ethiopian securityforces-triple the official figure-and that most were shot, beaten, orstrangled.[280]However the deputy chairman of the inquiry, Judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha,alleged that the government officials pressured the inquiry team to change itsconclusion that security forces used excessive force; both he and the chairmanof the commission fled Ethiopiaafter receiving death threats. To date the report has not been made public andthere was no known international reaction to the findings or the inquiry'scontroversial aftermath.[281]The Rationale for Donor Silence on EthiopiaThe muted international response to Ethiopia's poor human rights record stems, amongother reasons, from the fact that Ethiopia,one of the world's poorest countries, is one of the largest recipients ofoverseas development assistance (ODA) in Africa.In 2006 it received a net amount of ODA of US$1.947 billion or 14.7 percent ofthe gross national income.[282]Donor governments appear to be reluctant to use thisleverage to promote improvements in human rights. Ethiopiais the second most populous country in Africa, has one of the largestmilitaries and provides several thousand troops to UN peacekeeping operations,is the host of the African Union, and is an important regional power surroundedby authoritarian governments in Sudanand Eritrea.From an international perspective (as well as from the point of view of manyEthiopians) the current EPRDF government is viewed as an improvement over theprevious Mengistu dictatorship, which was responsible for the deaths ofhundreds of thousands of Ethiopians during its bloody 17-year rule.The EPRDF government is credited with making significanteconomic progress in the face of serious challenges, including recovering fromthe devastating Mengistu years and the economic and human losses of the 1998 warwith Eritrea.[283]Over the past few years Prime Minister Meles has won praise from donors forpoverty reduction and for efforts to decentralize the federal government andstrengthen service provision at local levels.In addition, Ethiopiais viewed by many western governments as a reliable and strategically importantregional partner on counter-terrorism efforts. The counter-terrorismpartnership, particularly with the United States,has assumed increasing importance amid growing concerns over the instability inneighboring Somalia.Most donor governments are willing to downplay or ignore thegovernment's poor human rights record and opt for "quiet" diplomacy, where theyreact at all, due to fears that public criticism will rupture diplomatic relations.The EPRDF government has not hesitated to expel foreigners for voicingcriticism, be they human rights activists, aid workers, journalists, or evenEuropean diplomats, a policy which has the desired effect of repressingoutspoken voices in defense of human rights.[284]Donor reluctance to criticize Ethiopiais compounded by the fact that many abuses go unreported, particularly in therural areas far from Addis Ababa,and "lack of information" is frequently cited as a reason for inaction.However, where there is a genuine lack of information it is largely due to theEthiopian government's heavy handed suppression of national and internationalindependent media and restrictions on freedom of expression. More often, keyinternational governments and institutions ignore the available informationabout serious human rights abuses.Western governments and companies are likely also fearfulthat a robust stance on human rights will strengthen Ethiopia'sties to China.Responses to Abuses in Somali RegionNone of the major international donors to Ethiopia-the US,EU, and UK-have condemned human rights abuses in Somali Region or publiclycalled on the Ethiopian government to end them. Privately some diplomatsconcede that they are concerned about the human rights situation, yet publicappeals have largely focused on humanitarian conditions and the need forEthiopian authorities to facilitate access for humanitarian agencies.The UN humanitarian assessment in Somali Region in late August2007 prompted fresh concern over deteriorating humanitarian conditions. Aconfidential human rights annex to the assessment report (which was presentedto the Ethiopian authorities but never published) concluded that "there areserious protection concerns relating to the civilian population and violationsof economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights in the Somali region.The protection of civilian populations and the investigation in to the humanrights claims require urgent attention."[285]The annex also called for the urgent establishment of an independent commissionof inquiry to investigate allegations of abuses.[286]Following the UN assessment, the European Union called for Ethiopiato "follow up all recommendations of the mission, including actions to protectcivilians in conflict."[287]  Diplomats in Addis Ababa sent several high-leveldelegations to the region, which prompted some releases of detainees from themany official and unofficial detention centers in advance of the visits. The UNestablished several new sub-offices in the region and in November 2007, thehighest UN official responsible for humanitarian affairs, John Holmes, visitedthe region. In advance of his visit, the Ethiopian authorities permitted anumber of international humanitarian organizations to start operations in theregion.[288]After his visit, Holmes warned the UN Security Council that "already chronicfood insecurity could give way to real famine conditions" and called on theEthiopian government to investigate the allegations of abuses.[289]While the UN and European Union have voiced public concernover the humanitarian situation, Ethiopia'smost important western donor and ally, the United States, has been publiclysilent. At a September 2007 news conference in Addis Ababa,the US government's topdiplomat for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, describedthe allegations of abuses in Somali Region as "unsubstantiated."[290]Some observers told Human Rights Watch that the USembassy in Addis Ababa sent strong cables to Washington describing serious concerns over militaryabuses, and that these cables have been suppressed or ignored in Washington. Observersalso say that while the US Ambassador to Ethiopia, Donald Yamamoto, hasprivately raised concerns over human rights abuses with Prime Minister Meles onseveral occasions, publicly the US embassy in Addis Ababa has activelydownplayed concerns in the face of a worsening humanitarian situation.[291]The US State Department's annual review of human rights in Ethiopia,issued in March 2008, provided a disingenuous analysis of the situation, notingthat "fighting between government forces and the [ONLF…] resulted in widespreadhuman rights abuses." The report then singled out only the ONLF for "widespreadhuman rights abuses" while implying that crimes committed by government forcesoccurred when "forces acted independently of government control."[292]The UKhas also showed little inclination to publicly criticize or assert theimportance of human rights improvements with the EPRDF government. The UK'said in 2007-2008 is due to reach 130 million sterling or more than US$260million, a doubling of the total aid given in 2004-2005.In its annual report on human rights published in March2008, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office(FCO) devoted a paragraph to theconflict in Somali Region. But the FCO's characterization of the conflict wasentirely one-sided. The report singled out only the human rights abuses of"terrorist groups operating in this region" forcriticism and noted with approval what it called "Ethiopia's commitment to protectcivilians in conflict."[293]A European Union troika delegation visited Somali Region inNovember 2007 but did not publicly comment on its visit. In early 2007, theEuropean Commission increased funding for humanitarian assistance across theHorn of Africa in response to the worsening drought, but there was no mentionof the abuses fuelling and exacerbating the humanitarian conditions.[294]The ONLF's April 2007 attack on Obole killed nine Chineseworkers at the oil field project run by Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau(ZPEB), a subsidiary of the state-owned Sinopec. Some of the same companiespreviously condemned for their activities in conflict-affected areas of Sudan,such as the Swedish company, Lundin Petroleum, and Malaysian oil company, Petronas,have also engaged in oil exploration in Somali Region.[295]Chinese officials immediately condemned the ONLF attack andsaid that it would not change Chinese policy of "conducting economiccooperation based on equality and mutual benefits in other countries."[296]  Prime Minister Meles was also quick to notethat the Ethiopian government had "taken effective measures to ensure it doesnot happen again," while the ONLF continued to warn oil companies to stay awayfrom the area.[297]In November 2007, the Chinese ambassador to Ethiopia indicated that Chinese oilworkers would return to the region, but made no comment on the allegations ofEthiopian military abuses.[298]Chinajustifies its silence on human rights issues by alluding to its core foreignpolicy of "non-interference" in what it considers to be the internal affairs ofother countries. China is animportant and growing economic partner of Ethiopiaand Africa more broadly.[299]Chinese-Ethiopian trade has increased 17 percent since 2006, to $660 million,and Chinese investment has reached $345 million from just $10 million fouryears ago, according to official figures. In addition to China's involvement inoil exploration and drilling projects in both Somali Region and Ethiopia'swestern Gambella state, Chinese companies are involved in an array of economicdevelopment and infrastructure initiatives, including Ethiopia's first privateindustrial zone,[300]hydropower projects,[301]road construction,[302]and other sectors. Still, China'seconomic ties to Ethiopiaare minimal compared to western countries.The diplomatic strategy of focusing purely on a humanitarianresponse to the needs in Somali Region is fundamentally flawed. While increasedand appropriately targeted humanitarian assistance is an essential component ofthe required response, it should not be seen as a substitute for action to curbthe governmental abuses described in this report.Given the constant pressure andthreats international agencies already face from the Ethiopian authorities,especially Ethiopian staff, humanitarian agencies, including the UN, are not ina position to provide serious protection to civilians in Somali Region.The responsibility to protect civilians lies elsewhere andmust be urgently addressed. It remains, first and foremost, with the Ethiopiangovernment, which must take serious measures not only to end the abuses, but toinvestigate and hold accountable the individuals responsible for them. However,it also lies with donor governments, who provide almost $2 billion of revenue tothe Ethiopian government each year without demanding human rightsaccountability.RecommendationsTo the federal government of EthiopiaIssueclear public orders to military commanders, regional police, and othermembers of the security services to cease extrajudicial killings, rape,torture, and the unlawful forced relocation of civilians. Seriousviolations of Ethiopian and international human rights and humanitarianlaw should be investigated and prosecuted as appropriate. Senior officialsimplicated, including as a matter of command responsibility, should beprosecuted regardless of rank.Ensurefundamental due process guarantees to persons in detention, including theright to be charged with an offense before judicial authorities, to haveaccess to legal counsel, family members, and medical care, and to receivea trial before an independent court meeting international fair trialstandards; allow access to persons in detention by independenthumanitarian organizations; and adopt measures to improve the criminaljustice system, such as by creating sufficient federal and regional courtsand providing appropriate training in human rights to judicial staff andpolice. Immediatelyend restrictions on commercial trade and livestock movement imposed on relevantzones of Somali Region (Fiiq, Korahe, Gode, Wardheer, and Dhagahbur),including the restrictions on cross-border trade with the semi-autonomousregion of Somaliland. Ending theserestrictions would immediately improve civilian access to food and otheressential commodities, in addition to reducing the short and long-termdamage to livelihoods caused by the blockade.Ensureindependent humanitarian organizations have full and unimpeded access tocivilians in need of humanitarian assistance in conflict-affected areas ofSomali Region; permit independent nutritional assessments to evaluateneeds of drought and conflict-affected areas; and support an independentevaluation of the humanitarian response, particularly the distribution offood aid.Establishan independent commission of inquiry to investigate crimes in violation ofinternational law committed in Somali Region and seek internationalassistance to investigate the crimes. Invitethe media, national and international human rights groups, and UN humanrights entities (including the UN Special Rapporteurs or SpecialRepresentatives on Internally Displaced Persons, Sexual and Gender-BasedViolence, and Extra-Judicial and Summary Executions; the Working Group onEnforced and Involuntary Disappearances; and the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights) to investigate and report on allegations ofabuses by all parties to the conflict and the general human rightssituation in Somali Region.Ceaseharassing and threatening victims and witnesses of human rights abuses inSomali Region and cooperate with efforts to improve protection ofcivilians, including by the United Nations.Provideappropriate human rights training to all members of the Ethiopian armedforces, including the federal, regional, and local police operating inSomali Region, and seek international support for such training programs.To the regional government of SomaliRegionalStateEnsurethat all detainees in facilities administered by regional securityauthorities are provided due process guarantees, including the right to becharged, to have access to legal counsel and relatives, and to be tried bya court meeting international fair trial standards; permit independenthumanitarian organizations access to all detainees. Ensureindependent humanitarian organizations have full and unimpeded access tocivilians in need of humanitarian assistance in conflict-affected areas ofSomali Region; permit independent nutritional assessments to evaluate needsof drought and conflict-affected areas; and support an independentevaluation of the humanitarian response, particularly the distribution offood aid.Seekinternational assistance for projects to assist rape victims, who havespecial needs. Such assistance should include outreach, medical services,and trauma counseling and testing, and access to anti-retroviral (ARV)therapy and treatment. Enddiscriminatory measures such as suspending state funding toconflict-affected weredas in Somali Region or demanding that families andclans pay compensation for deaths inflicted by the ONLF. To the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF)Issueorders to all commanders to end targeted and indiscriminate attacks on civilians,including government officials. Ceasethe use of all anti-personnel mines and the indiscriminate use ofanti-vehicle mines that may affect civilian, commercial, or humanitarianconvoys.Cooperatewith any independent efforts to investigate and report on abuses by allparties to the conflict and the general human rights situation in SomaliRegion. Publiclycommit to respect international humanitarian law, particularly Article 3common to the Geneva Conventions and Protocol II.To foreign governments with influence, includingthe US, UK,China,and European UnionPubliclycall upon the Ethiopian government to conduct a thorough, transparent, andindependent investigation into abuses in Somali Region. Closely monitorthe progress of government investigations and take prompt and appropriateaction in response to their findings. Privatelyand publicly urge the Ethiopian government to implement immediately theabove recommendations, and insist that implementation of these steps willbe used to assess Ethiopian willingness to improve the human rightssituation in Somali Region.Callupon the Ethiopian government to permit full, unimpeded access to Somaliregion by independent humanitarian agencies, national and internationalhuman rights groups, the media, and diplomatic representatives.Urgethe Ethiopian government to support independent nutritional assessments toevaluate the needs of drought and conflict-affected areas and independent monitoringof food distribution, and insist on an independent evaluation of thehumanitarian response, particularly the distribution of food aid, thatincludes an external audit. Monitordevelopment funding to ensure that it is not used for Ethiopian securityoperations, including by regional, wereda and kebele leveladministrations.Makemilitary assistance to Ethiopiacontingent on the government's adherence to international human rights andhumanitarian law and exclude any assistance to units implicated in abuses.All suppliers should actively monitor the use of any weapons andnon-lethal items to ensure they are not being utilized to commit orfacilitate abuses. Ifproviding military assistance, pressure the government to abide by itscommitments under international law. Donor states should publicly condemnspecific violations, particularly the forced displacement of villages, extrajudicialexecutions, and torture committed by the armed forces,and urge the government to address them.Demandthat civilian and military officials implicated in human rights violationsbe held accountable, including as a matter ofcommand responsibility.To the United Nations Security CouncilPubliclyurge that the Ethiopian government conduct a thorough, transparent, andindependent investigation into abuses by all parties to the conflict inSomali Region.

Confidential communication to Human Rights Watch, June 2007.[61]The resurrection of the WSLF name and allusion to "Greater Somalia" suggeststhat it may draw support from non-Ogaadeeni clan members seeking to distancethemselves from the ONLF and its "Ogadenia"-centered agenda.

However it soon began pursuing amilitary strategy, including grenade attacks and bombings in Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa, prompting an Ethiopian offensive againstal-Itihaad bases in both Somali Region and the Gedo region of neighboring Somaliabetween 1992 and 1997. This operation is largely believed to have dismantledal-Itihaad's military wing. The deputy leader of al-Itihaad, Sheikh HassanDahir Aweys, later became a leader of the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia.For further analysis of the origins of al-Itihaad in both countries seeInternational Crisis Group, "Somalia'sIslamists," Africa Report no. 100, December 12, 2005.

Triffterer, ed.) (1999), p. 122. This is the standard applied by Article7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Ethiopia is not a state party tothe Rome Statute and is therefore not bound by it, but the definition inarticle 7 accords with the conception of crimes against humanity in customaryinternational law.[260]Murder and torture are among thecore offenses that have been included within the definition of crimes againsthumanity at least since the adoption of the charter establishing the Nuremberg tribunal afterWorld War II. Deportation (to another country) was listed but not (internal)forced transfer. Rape was not explicitly included in the charter's definitionof crimes against humanity in article 6(c) although it could be derived fromthat definition's general prohibition against "other inhumane acts." Thisambiguity has been resolved in recent years; the statutes of the InternationalCriminal Tribunals for Rwandaand the former Yugoslaviaas well as the Rome Statute all explicitly include rape in the list ofenumerated offenses that can constitute crimes against humanity. The ICCStatute also lists: extermination, enslavement, deportation and forcibletransfer of population, imprisonment, persecution, enforced disappearance,apartheid, and "other inhumane acts." ICC Statute, article 7(1).[261]See, e.g., Prosecutor v. Naletilic and Martinovic, International Criminal Tribunalfor the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Trial Chamber, March 31 2003, par. 235 ("Thepopulation against whom the attack is directed is considered civilian if it ispredominantly civilian"); Prosecutor v. Akayesu, International Criminal Tribunalfor Rwanda (ICTR), Trial Chamber, September 2, 1998, par. 582 ("Where there arecertain individuals within the civilian population who do not come within thedefinition of civilians, this does not deprive the population of its civiliancharacter"); Prosecutor v.

Tadic, ICTY Trial Chamber,para. 646 ("it is now well establishedthat…the acts…can…occur on either a widespread basis or in a systematic manner.Either one of these is sufficient to exclude isolated or random acts.").[264]Akayesu definedwidespread as "massive, frequent, large scale action, carried out collectivelywith considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims," Prosecutor v.

Blaskic (paras. 258-259) listed factors fromwhich could be inferred knowledge of the context:[a] the historical and political circumstances inwhich the acts of violence occurred; [b] the functions of the accused when thecrimes were committed; [c] his responsibilities within the political ormilitary hierarchy; [d] the direct and indirect relationship between thepolitical and military hierarchy; [e] the scope and gravity of the actsperpetrated; [f] the nature of the crimes committed and the degree to whichthey are common knowledge.[271]See, e.g., UN GeneralAssembly Resolution 3074, "Principles of international cooperation in thedetention, arrest, extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimesand crimes against humanity," December3, 1973.
