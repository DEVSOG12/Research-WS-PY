SummarySince 2003, large numbers of Chinese citizens have been heldincommunicado for days or months in secret, unlawful detention facilities.These facilities, known informally as "black jails" (黑监狱) or "black houses" (黑房屋),[1]are created and used primarily by local and provincial officials to detainpetitioners who come to Beijing and provincial capitals seeking redress forcomplaints that are not resolved at lower levels of government. Public securityofficials in Beijing and other cities have not intervened to close the jailsand, in at least some instances, have directly assisted black jail operators. Thisreport, drawing on dozens of face-to-face interviews with former detainees in Beijing and other cities, details what happens to individuals once inside. Detainees are oftenphysically and psychologically abused. Many are deprived of food, sleep, andmedical care, and they are subject to theft and extortion by their guards. Theyhave no access to family members or to legal counsel or to courts. The makeshiftjails are found in state-owned hostels, hotels,nursing homes, and mental hospitals, among other locations. Some Chineseresearchers and civil society activists suggest that the number of individualsdetained in black jails each year reaches into the thousands.The Chinese government denies the existence of black jails.In the "Outcome Report" issued by the UN Human Rights Council at theconclusion of its "Universal Period Review" of China's human rights record inJune 2009, the Chinese government asserted: "There are no blackjails in the country." China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs likewise denied theexistence of black jails in response to a question from an Al Jazeeracorrespondent at an April 27, 2009, ministry press briefing in Beijing.These denials persist despite reports by Chinese and foreignjournalists who have visited black jails and despite academic research into thesubject by well-regarded Chinese scholars. Some foreign journalists and atleast one Chinese legal scholar who have investigated black jails havethemselves been physically abused and/or temporarily detained by guards at suchfacilities.The existence of the black jails directly contradicts Chinesegovernment rhetoric about its commitment to rule of law and its respect for therights and freedoms of its people. In 2004, the Chinese government amended the constitutionto read that, "The state respects and preserves human rights." On December 12,2008, Chinese President Hu Jintao marked the 60th anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by affirming a "people first"policy in promoting the development of human rights. Most recently, on April13, 2009, the Chinese government issued its first ever National Human RightsAction Plan (2009-2010), which states that, "The Chinese governmentunswervingly pushes forward the cause of human rights in China."The majority of black jail detainees are petitioners-citizensfrom rural areas who come to Beijing and provincial capitals seeking redressfor abuses ranging from illegal land grabs and corruption to police torture. Petitioners,as citizens who have done nothing wrong-in fact, who are exercising their legalright to complain of being wronged themselves-are often persecuted bygovernment officials, who employ security forces and plainclothes thugs knownas retrievers or jiefang renyuan, to abduct them, often violently, andthen detain them in black jails. Plainclothes thugs often actively assist blackjail operators and numerous analysts believe that they do so at the behest of,or at least with the blessing of, municipal police.Human rights abuses related to China's black jails bear astriking similarity to those of the official compulsory custody-and-repatriation,or shourong qiansong, system, which the government abruptly abolished inJune 2003. Shourong, a vagrancy detention system, legally allowed policeto detain "undesirables"-mostly petitioners, but also including beggars and anyindividuals who lacked official identification papers-and to transfer them toofficial "relief and repatriation" centers where they were held for a shortperiod of time before being returned to their home districts. Researchersreported that extralegal black jails began operating within months of theabolition of the vagrancy detention system.Black jails symbolize the failure of China's petitioning, or letters-and-visits system, a lawful practice dating back to the Qing dynasty(1644-1911) in which citizens bring their appeals for justice to the attentionof the central government in Beijing. The petitioning system remains enshrinedin Chinese law, with new regulations on "protecting the lawful rights andinterests" of petitioners issued as recently as January 2005. However, thepetitioning system is at odds with an official civil service evaluation systemin which government officials at county, municipal, and provincial levels aresubject to financial and career advancement penalties if large numbers ofcitizens from their areas are discovered in Beijing seeking legal redressthrough petitioning.Faced with financial incentives to keep petitioners out ofsight in Beijing, but no longer armed with a legal means for doing so, provincialand municipal-level officials have developed an extrajudicial system tointercept, abduct, and detain petitioners in black jails. Such officials makedaily cash payments to the institutions which host the black jails of 150 yuan(US$22) to300 yuan (US$44) per person.Inside China's black jails, detainees are denied access tolegal counsel and in most cases contact with family and friends. Detainees arekept under constant surveillance, and subject to often arbitrary physical andpsychological abuse including beatings, sexual violence, threats, andintimidation. In some black jail facilities, guards deprive detainees of foodand sleep as mechanisms to punish, control, or elicit information fromdetainees. Black jail conditions are uniformly harsh. Detainees endure crowdedsleeping quarters, unsanitary conditions, poor quality food in insufficientquantities, and violent reprisals for complaints about such conditions.The guards at black jails routinely deny detainees access toneeded medical care, even in cases of injuries from beatings. One former blackjail detainee resorted to a three-day hunger strike to compel her captors toallow her access to a doctor. Former black jail detainees report that guards oftensteal detainees' personal belongings, including petitioning documents, demandpayment for food or lodging at the black jail facilities, and demand large lumpsum payments as high as 15,000 yuan (US$2,205) as a condition of release.Minors under the age of 18 have been detained at blackjails, a blatant violation of China's commitments to the rights and welfare ofchildren. One former detainee we interviewed was a 15-year-old girl, abductedfrom the streets of Beijing while petitioning on behalf of her disabled father.She said she had been locked up in a nursing home in Gansu province for morethan two months and subjected to severe beatings.Key RecommendationsThe Chinese government should:Admit the existence of blackjails; close them and set detainees at liberty; and punish any person whoabducts and detains another unlawfully or who operates or facilitates theoperation of a black jail.Initiate a mass publiceducation campaign about the legal rights of petitioners, the criminalityof efforts to abduct, detain, and abuse them in black jails, and the dueprocess rights of all criminal suspects under Chinese law andinternational instruments.Establish an independent commission to investigate andpublicly report on the existence of black jails and government efforts toeradicate them.Governments and international bodies funding Chinese legalreform or concern with human rights in China, including the United States, theEuropean Union, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank should take anactive interest in China's ongoing legal reform progress, and to that end should:Express strong concern toChinese officials about the existence of black jails and violations of therights of detainees, emphasizing that the jails violate both Chinese andinternational law.Demand that such abuses stop, that perpetrators be punished,and that victims be provided with reasonable compensation.A more comprehensive set of recommendations is set forth atthe end of this report.II. MethodologyHuman Rights Watch conducted research for this report in Beijingand several other Chinese cities between April and May 2009. We spoke with 38 formerblack jail detainees from the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Gansu, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shandong, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, and from the municipality of Chongqing. The detaineesincluded men, women, and children, and individuals of varying socio-economicbackgrounds. The report also draws on Chinese academic research, studies bydomestic Chinese human rights organizations, and published accounts in bothChinese domestic and international media.In conducting the research, our objective was to identifyand speak with as many individuals as possible who had been detained in blackjails, not solely petitioners. All those we interviewed, however, were petitionersand they reported that the people they had been detained with were alsopetitioners. While this suggests that black jails are used primarily againstpetitioners, it is possible that other such facilities exist and are used tohouse other categories of detainees. It is a question that merits furtherresearch.The Chinese government strictly limits the activities ofcivil society and nongovernmental organizations on a variety of subjects,particularly those related to the operations of the nation's security forces. Ourresearch thus required a high level of sensitivity to the security of bothresearchers and interviewees. The interviews took place in circumstances inwhich they could be conducted without surveillance and possible harassment bygovernment officials or security forces. All those interviewed were informed ofthe purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which thedata would be used, and orally consented to be interviewed. All were told thatthey could decline to answer questions or could end the interview at any time.Participants did not receive any material compensation.Because of the real possibility of reprisals, we have withheldthe names of all of the former black jail detainees we spoke with.The findings of this report are consistent with research byChinese human rights organizations, including investigative reports by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Chinese and international group that focuses on exposing human rights abuses and promoting human rights capacity-building and advocacy, and a second Chinese human rights group which has expresslyrequested that its name be withheld.II. BackgroundThe petition system seems to have maintained hope fordisadvantaged people who have suffered injustices, but as a matter of fact, itis like drinking poison to quench a thirst.-Peking University law professor He Weifang [2]China's BrokenPetitioning SystemThe recent appearance of black jails is the product ofsystemic failures in China's "letters and visits," or petitioning, system.The petitioning system is a modern version of an imperial traditionwhich legally permits Chinese citizens to report local official abuses or locallegal decisions to higher levels of government.[3] Becauselocal courts regularly refuse to accept cases against local officials, andbecause pursuing legal redress through the court system can be prohibitivelyexpensive, particularly for rural Chinese, petitioning has become one of theonly accessible means of legal redress.Petitioners typically begin their pursuit of legal redressat local-level petitioner complaint offices, which are located in courthousesor in township-level government offices. If they are not satisfied, they canmove up the government hierarchy to provincial level offices and, at thehighest level, the State Bureau for Letters and Visits in Beijing.[4]The Chinese government has over the past five yearsreiterated its support for the petitioning system, describing it as anindispensable means to ease the frustrations of citizens who are unable forwhatever reason to resolve their legal problems at the local level. In March2009, Premier Wen Jiabao praised the petitioning system as a "mechanism toresolve social conflicts, and guide the public to express their requests andinterests through legal channels."[5] YuLingyu, director of the Supreme Court's Bureau of Implementation, in July 2009described the petitioning system as "work which is done to allay the anxietyand relieve the difficulties of the masses and the basic work of establishing asocialist and harmonious society."[6]The State Bureau for Letters and Visits has reported asteady increase in petitions since 1993, saying the numbers are "straining thenational (petitioning) system."[7] OfficialChinese government statistics indicate that petition offices annually handledaround 10 million inquiries and complaints from petitioners from 2003 to 2007.[8]Despite its longevity and political support, the petitioning system has neverfunctioned effectively, in large part because it is chronically overwhelmed bythe number of people seeking redress.[9] In a 2004Chinese Academy of Social Sciences survey of a sample of 632 petitioners inBeijing by Yu Jianrong, "信访制度批判"(Critique of the Petition System), revealed that only 0.2 percent of themsuccessfully resolved their problems through the petition system.[10]Petitioners who have petitioned several years to tens ofyears are not rare. One reason is due to government departments who are evasiveand prolong matters; another is because the petitioning system inherently haslimitations to its power. The channels for petitioning are obstructed; theproblems of petitioners are transferred, not handled, the rate of effectivenessis very low.[11]As a result, large numbers of petitioners who come to Beijing remain there for long periods of time, hoping their grievances will be resolved. Buttheir very presence collides with central government directives that localgovernments reduce the flow of petitioners to Beijing.An academic article by Yu Jianrong suggests that the centralgovernment, fearing petitioners' potential to instigate unrest and disliking"undesirables" on the capital's streets, has made controlling the flow ofpetitioners to the capital one of the basic metrics of the effectiveness of regionaland local officials.[12] Penaltiesfor exceeding those limits range from private reprimands to humiliating andpotentially career-ending public criticisms.[13]The Chinese government has never publicly circulated detailsof this system of bureaucratic reprisals against local government officialsdeemed responsible for allowing petitioners to reach or remain in Beijing. However,Chinese Human Rights Defenders has obtained several internal county-levelgovernment documents which make clear that penalties are levied against local officialswho fail to take decisive action when petitioners from their geographical areaseek legal redress in provincial capitals and Beijing. The extent of the penaltieshinge upon a "point deduction" system used in official performance evaluationsof local officials.[14] Onedocument is a 2007 directive from Hunan province's Shimen County specifying theobligation of county officials to retrieve local petitioners who go to Hunan's capital or Beijing:Regarding those who go to petition at the provincialcapital or to Beijing and those who persistently petition unreasonably, if theyare returned to the county and sent to law learning classes in a timely manner...addtwo points [to the evaluation of the relevant official]. Failure to implementthis, deduct half-a-point.[15]According to one legal expert in Beijing, "Petitioners arebad for [local] government officials [because] officials' positions, career prospectsand salaries are all linked to the number of petitioners coming to Beijing, so they want to control them."[16]The result is that petitioners to Beijing are routinelyintercepted, harassed, and detained by government officials and security forcesfrom their home areas intent on ensuring that petitioners are not detectedseeking legal redress in Beijing or other major cities. Such abuses constituteserious violations of guarantees of freedoms of expression and associationembodied in both international and Chinese law.[17]The mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Daily, hasitself reported the occurrence of "local governments using violent means tointercept petitioners from reaching higher levels of government."[18]Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications law professor Xu Zhiyong hascompared the plight of China's petitioners to "...an alleyway in hell; with somuch naked savagery and violence. It gives us a concentrated glimpse of all thesicknesses in Chinese society."[19] In an academicpaper published in April 2009, Yu Jianrong described the relationship betweenpetitioners and their local governments as inherently conflicted:[L]ocal governments are not resolving problems but insteadare intercepting petitioners, de-registering petitions, detaining people,charging fines, employing re-education through labor and criminal punishments,punishing family members, and using other control tactics to suppresspetitioners.[20]In August 2009, the Chinese government announced regulatorymoves aimed to prevent any petitioners who have already initiated legalproceedings for redress in local courts from also petitioning in Beijing, an initiative which will likely intensify extrajudicial measures to abduct anddetain petitioners who come to Beijing regardless. On August 6, 2009, ZhouBenshun, secretary general of the Political and Legislative Affairs Committee(PLAC) of the Communist Party's Central Committee, urged local governments toredouble their efforts to address petitioners' concerns at the county andvillage levels as a means to ensure that "[Petitioners'] problems can be solvedwithout coming to Beijing."[21] OnAugust 19, 2009, the PLAC reiterated that message by announcing that theyet-to-be-published regulations are designed to ensure that petitioners should"not seek solutions by visiting Beijing" and task local government officialswith weekly and monthly meetings with petitioners at the grassroots level toresolve petitioners' grievances.[22]The Abolition of Legal"custody and repatriation" and the Emergence of China's Black JailsThere are convincing indications that a key reason for the emergenceof China's extrajudicial system of black jails was the abolition of thecompulsory custody-and-repatriation, or shourong qiansong, system in2003. Shourong, a form of vagrancy detention enacted by the StateCouncil in 1982, gave municipal police wide powers to arbitrarily arrest anddetain any "undesirables" on city streets, particularly homeless people andbeggars who had come from the rural countryside.[23]Under these regulations, police could detain any citizen who lacked an urbanhousehold registration certificate, or hukou, which by definitionincluded any petitioners from the countryside.[24] The shourongvagrancy detention system involved a nationwide network of 700 officialdetention centers where police could arbitrarily detain any "undesirables" andthen repatriate them to their home provinces.[25]The lack of due process within this vagrancy detention systemled to detainee abuse and human rights violations. In March 2003, Sun Zhigang,a migrant worker detained by police in Guangzhou for not carrying his temporaryurban residence certificate, was beaten to death in a shourong center. Intensedomestic public dismay followed,[26] and inJune 2003 the government unexpectedly announced the abolition of the vagrancydetention system. Facilities were closed, and the police no longer had thepower to arbitrarily detain "undesirables."[27] TheChinese government officially replaced the vagrancy detention system with theMeasures on Aid and Management for Urban Homeless and Beggars (MAMUHB) onAugust 1, 2003.[28] The Chinesegovernment described the MAMUHB as a system designed to "providetemporary shelter for the homeless in a bid to maintain social order incities."[29] That system hinges on specially-built shelters in which urbanhomeless can seek, on a strictly voluntary basis, temporary shelter for amaximum of ten days.[30]Some Chinese police accustomed to the wide powers ofdetention granted by the former vagrancy detentionsystem expressedconcern in the wake of its abolition. "In the past, we had more power and thatmade our work easier. The custody and repatriation system (was) a very goodmeasure for big cities," a police officer in the southern city of Guangzhou told the South China Morning Post in October, 2003.[31]But vagrancy detention-era abuses did not end with theabolition of shourong. Instead, such abuses have been driven undergroundinto new extrajudicial "black jails" in Beijing and other cities. Localgovernment officials, security forces, and the thugs they hire use suchfacilities to keep individuals officially deemed as "undesirables," such aspetitioners, off the streets of Beijing and in many cases back to their homeprovinces to spare local officials bureaucratic punishment for allowingpetitioners to come to the capital.China's Black Jails SystemThe Chinese government has a history of extralegal detention.During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), government officials and security forcesroutinely detained individuals suspected of anti-government sentiments infacilities described as "study classes," or xuexi ban, without formalarrest, trial, or due process of law.[32] TheChinese government also has a record of targeting "whistleblowers and exposersof official corruption, persistent complainants and petitioners" for extralegaldetention in mental institutions.[33] Sincethe 1980s, extralegal detention measures by government officials and securityforces have targeted violators of China's official one-child policy as well asfollowers of the outlawed Falungong movement.[34]China's police also have legal powers to routinely imposeadministrative detention via "re-education through labor," or laojiao,and house arrest, or ruanjin. Re-education through labor allows thepolice to unilaterally impose custodial sentences of up to three years whiledepriving detainees of any due process of law and judicial oversight.[35]House arrest, which Chinese police can impose completely arbitrarily and outside of any legal procedure, results in detention at home, withrestricted and monitored internet and phone communications, and 24-hoursurveillance by unidentified and often aggressive security forces.[36]Chinese legal scholars and academics who have researchedblack jails say that their emergence since 2003 constitutes one of the mostserious and widespread uses of extralegal detention in China's recent history.A Chinese legal expert who has extensively researched the issue of black jails estimatesthat the number of incidents in which citizens are illegally detained each yearin black jails in Beijing alone is as high as 10,000, though that numberincludes individuals who are detained on multiple occasions.[37]Various non-governmental sources have estimated the number of black jails at between7[38]and 50.[39]Tracking black jails is difficult due to the secretive nature of theiroperations and the fact that many appear to operate on a temporary, "as needed"basis in response to abductions. An Al Jazeera television correspondentvisited a Beijing black jail facility in April 2009 with a former detainee,only to find the location empty and unguarded for reasons unknown.[40]Xu Zhiyong, the Beijing University of Posts andTelecommunications law professor quoted above, is one of a small number oflocal activists seeking to expose and abolish the black jail system. Hedescribed his impressions of the Beijing facility he visited in September 2008:It is not an exaggeration to call it a black jail. Therewere several scores of petitioners imprisoned here. The government had hiredthugs as guards. Thedifference between this [black jail] and a regularprison is that the petitioners in this prison are completely innocent. Theywere brought here without any legal process to be locked up when they went tothe complaints departments such as at the Bureau of Letters and Visits or theSupreme Court in order to conduct regular petitioning.[41]Local government officials often employ those agents,plainclothes thugs commonly known as retrievers, or jiefang renyuan, tolocate and abduct petitioners in Beijing and other cities. Experiencedretrievers are paid well for their services, including bounties as high asU$250 per person.[42]Retrievers often recognize their province's most doggedpetitioners on sight. Since petitioners are paid only to bring back people fromtheir own provinces, a common tactic is to ask petitioners where they're from.Even if they lie, their accents will probably give them away. Sometimesretrievers don shabby clothes and pose as petitioners. Retrievers often bribe[petitioning office] clerks...to prevent petitioners' gripes from beingprocessed.[43]Black jail operators themselves extract substantialfinancial rewards from local governments in return for providing the facilitiesto detain petitioners from their respective areas. "[A black jail operator]charges the respective local governments or their liaison offices in Beijing 300 yuan (US$44) per petitioner to 200 yuan (US$29) for each day of detention plusother miscellaneous fees like medical fees."[44] XuZhiyong has uncovered a sliding scale of payments by local governments to blackjail operators in Beijing. "If a city petitioner is locked up for one day, thelocal government pays 200 yuan (US$29), for rural petitioners one day (costs)150 yuan (US$22)."[45]Investigative reporting by both local and foreigncorrespondents indicate that some black jail operators are also requiringdetainees to pay for their release and/or the costs of their own detention. A ChinaYouth Daily reporter interviewed a former black jail detainee from Jiangsu province who said his chief jailer told him, "Give a 10,000 yuan (US$1,470)deposit, write an affidavit that you won't petition again then (add to that) afood fee of 200 yuan (US$29) per day. Then you can go!"[46]In September 2007, a Reuters correspondent stumbled upon a black jail in Beijing operated by officials from Henan province's Nanyang municipality, which had becomea de facto detention outsourcing center for local governments from other partsof China.[47]The novelty of the Nanyang operation appears to be turningdetention into a commercial service, with other local governments paying it tocatch and hold protesting residents. The eight petitioners from east andnortheast China separately said they had been lured or dragged from streets,government offices and a state-run detention center to the jail. Petitionerssaid they believed from guards' comments that the jail charged other localgovernments from 200 yuan (US$29) to 300 yuan (US$44) a day to hold them untilthey were taken home, sometimes released on the spot, or dumped outside thecity.[48]There have been numerous reports by both foreign media anddomestic human rights organizations of large numbers of petitioners routinely detainedin the Beijing Financial Assistance Management Center.[49]This facility, commonly referred to as Majialou, is in the city'ssouthern Fengtai district, near numerous central government petitioning officesincluding that of the Supreme Court of China. Majialou is one of Beijing's four official homeless relief centers established by the post-vagrancy detentionsystem, as set forth in Measures on Aid and Management for Urban Homeless andBeggars described above.[50] Butaccording to research conducted by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, it has becomea location where petitioners "...are registered and detained before officialsthere notify interceptors from their local areas, who then take the petitionersaway and forcibly escort them back to their home provinces."[51]Secret Facilities, SpartanConditionsBlack jail facilities are often temporary; the number in operationat any given time is dependent on the number of detained petitioners. Formerblack jail detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch have described blackjails in government ministry buildings, hotels, hostels, nursing homes, mentalhospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, and residential buildings, amongothers. Black jails are unmarked and their purpose usually undetectable topassers-by. One detainee told us, "[The black jail] was in a simple bungalow,which from the outside wouldn't raise an eyebrow and people wouldn't notice [asdistinct in any way]."[52]The facilities share several key characteristics: they areorganized to severely restrict detainees' freedom of movement, association, andexpression through locked doors, locked and barred windows, restrictions onaccess to phones and other communications, and 24-hour surveillance by guardsarmed with weapons, including clubs and guns.[53] A localhuman rights group has described the facilities in detail:A Black house will often be located behind, under or in anoperating hotel, inn, or hostel and as part of a city's or province's petitionoffice in Beijing. The Black house, managed by Letters and Visits officials[from the provinces] working in Beijing, will then hire people to work asguards, and pay the hotel, hostel or inn a small price for the use of thespecific part of the establishment. A part of the location will consist of aprison area; using rooms as holding cells, often equipped with iron bars anddoors, and will sometimes also have a fenced-in outdoor area. A second part [ofthe facility] will hold offices for the guards and retrievers, and sometimes anarea where newly-arrived inmates will be stripped of their ID cards, cellphones, etc. In the vast majority of cases, a black jail will handlepetitioners from one specific location, such as a city or province. This is dueto the fact that black jails are operated and paid for by the Letters andVisits office of that particular location. Hence, the petition offices in provincialcapital X will, to ensure that petitioners do not "escape" from the provincialchain of petitioning by going to Beijing, set up an "office" in Beijing. This office, a black jail, will then send 'retrievers' out to watch trainstations, petition offices, shelters and other areas known to be frequented bypetitioners. When a petitioner from their locality is found, he or she will beapprehended and brought back to the black jail for detention.[54]The majority of former black jail detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch described conditions in those facilities as akin to a prisonin terms of security measures and denial of freedom of movement. "[There were]locked steel doors and windows. We never left our rooms to eat, [instead] wewere given our meals through a small window space," said a 53-year-oldpetitioner from Heilongjiang province who was abducted while petitioning inBeijing and was subsequently detained in a black jail facility in a governmentbuilding in his home town for the month of October 2007.[55]Sleeping facilities range from separate, locked hotel roomsfor each individual detainee[56] tocramped conditions in which petitioners share rooms of up to eight bunk beds.[57]One petitioner spent eight days in a Beijing black jail located in a Jilin provincial government facility devoid of furniture, where detainees had to sit andsleep on the bare floors.[58]Police ComplicityThe Beijing municipal police have played an active role inabuses against petitioners in the capital, including "turning a blind eye tothe retaliatory violence" meted out to petitioners by plainclothes thugs whoappear to operate at official behest.[59]Two of the 38 former black jail detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch saidthat Beijing police, in one incident in plainclothes[60]and in the second incident in uniform,[61] assistedprovincial-level security forces in abducting and detaining the petitioners in Beijing.Such police indifference to the plight of black jaildetainees is common, according to a Beijing-based legal expert who hasresearched the problem of black jails.Local police don't help. Local government officials oftenhave relationships with the Beijing police, so Beijing police don't interfere[in black jail operations]. Police see petitioners as "disrupting stability"and also [refuse to act] due to jurisdictional issues; they leave [petitionersin black jails] to the local government officials.[62]A former detainee from Jiangsu province told Human RightsWatch that municipal police showed up at the black jail facility located in a Beijing hotel where he was held and "made a report," but then departed without explanationand without freeing him from custody.[63] Anotherformer detainee said that Beijing police did not respond to his "110" calls forassistance after he was detained by Heilongjiang petitioning officials in ablack jail facility in a central Beijing building.[64]A woman from Heilongjiang province detained in a Ministry of Social Affairsbuilding in her home province said that when she contacted police forassistance, they candidly explained that they had no power to intervene incases of black jail detentions.[Your detention] is the desire of upper levels [of government],and if you have opinions about that when this is over, consult the citygovernment authorities or the mayor to solve. Anything that happens inside[black jails] we can't go to investigate and [we] can't solve any of yourproblems.[65]There is also evidence that Beijing police work closely withretrievers ahead of important dates on the Chinese Communist Party's calendar,such as the run-up to annual meetings of China's parliament.[66]At those times, police in the provinces prioritize preventing petitioners fromreaching Beijing,[67] whilethe Ministry of Public Security urges Beijing municipal police to "mobilize allof their resources" to prevent petitioners already in the city from reachingcentral government offices.[68] TheChinese government explicitly linked an initiative announced in August 2009 toimprove resolution of petitioners' grievances at the village and county levelsto efforts to prevent petitioners from coming to Beijing where they mightdisturb "social harmony and stability ahead of China's National Day celebrationin October (2009)."[69]Black Jails as "Study Classes"The local and provincial government officials and members ofthe security forces who operate black jails have in some cases described whatgoes on in the facilities as "study classes" devoted to educating petitionersabout their alleged wrongdoing. Zhang Jianping, a Jiangsu human rightsactivist, described this justification as emblematic of the lack of rule of lawin China. "These black jails are clearly against the law. But localofficials call them legal study classes, and that shows how they treat the lawas just a tool for abusing rights," Zhang said.[70]A March 2009 investigative report in the China YouthDaily uncovered how government officials and security forces from Jiangsuprovince's Xiang Shui County had abducted local petitioners in Beijing,returned them under guard to Xiang Shui, and imprisoned them in a black jailwhich the county's Civil Affairs Bureau described as a "Petitioning StudyClass."[71] Thereport revealed that at least ten local petitioners had been detained in thefacility, located within an abandoned primary school, and subjected to threats,intimidation, and physical violence until they paid a 10,000 yuan (US$1,471) "deposit"and a "food fee" of 200 yuan (US$29) per day. They were prevented from leavinguntil they signed an affidavit stating that they would never petition again.[72]Three former black jail detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch said that their abductors had justified detaining them on thebasis of an alleged legal obligation to undertake petitioning-related "studyclasses," while ten others said that their captors described their black jailas a "study class" facility only after their arrival at the facility. Severalinterviewees dismissed the "study class" label as a cynical veneer oflegitimacy. A female petitioner from Jiangsu province detained in a black jailfor 36 days in July-August 2008 said the "study class" label her guards used torefer to the facility was an attempt to ensure the black jail "wouldn't lookillegal."[73]Another woman detained in a self-styled "study class" in Heilongjiang province described her experience: "They said it was a petitioning school, butI never saw a teacher there, all I ever saw were police and flies."[74]Several other former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that theywere forced to sign affidavits upon release from black jail facilities whichstated that they had not been detained, but had instead participated in a"study class" of their own free will.[75] Otherformer detainees described attempts by their black jail guards to lead "studyclasses" which consisted of anti-petitioning propaganda sessions.They called it "legal education"...to allow petitioners tobe regarded as criminals. There was no class...it was a joke. However, theysometimes did ideology work with petitioners and urged them not to come back toBeijing to petition, [but instead] go back home to seek out their localgovernment to solve their problems.[76]III. Human RightsAbuses in Black Jails[The guards] entered without a word, grabbed me... kneed mein the chest and pounded my lower belly with their fists until I passed out.After it was over I was in pain, but they hadn't left a mark on my body.-A 45-year-old male petitioner from Anhui province detainedin a Beijing black jail from February 22-29, 2009[77]The individuals detained in black jails are often physicallyand psychologically abused. Many are deprived of food, sleep, and medical care,and are subject to theft and extortion by their guards. They have no access tofamily members or to legal counsel or courts.Illegal Abductions32 of the 38 former black jail detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch reported having been abducted by individuals whom they recognizedas government officials and/or security forces from their home provinces, oftenin plainclothes. As one detainee said: "[Police and petitioning officials frommy hometown] who weren't in uniform and who never showed me their officialidentification detained me."[78]Petitioners, of course, have broken no law by simply beingpresent in Beijing to carry out lawful petitioning activity. But even if theyhad broken some law, their abduction would violate both Chinese andinternational law governing arrests and detentions. The Universal Declarationof Human Rights prohibits "arbitrary arrest (and) detention"[79]and guarantees "full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independentimpartial tribunal."[80] Article37 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates arrestsmust be conducted "with the approval or by decision of a people's procuratorateor by decision of a people's court and arrests must be made by a publicsecurity organ."The majority of the former black jail detainees interviewedby Human Rights Watch said that their abductors, who commonly worked in groupsof up to 20 individuals,[81]provided no legal justification for detention or any information aboutdetainees' eventual destination or possible length of detention. One 52-year-oldpetitioner from Liaoning province detained in Beijing on April 16, 2009, saidher abductors, who escorted her back to a month-long stay in a black jail locatedin her home province of Liaoning, were a complete mystery to her.I was detained by retrievers from [my home province of] Liaoning who were in plainclothes and never showed me any identification. I doubt they hadany [official] identification. They never told me the reason why they detainedme; they never even spoke to me and didn't tell me how long they were going todetain me for.[82]The majority of former black jail detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch reported being abducted off the streets of Beijing or othercities. One 43-year-old petitioner from Jiangsu province, who said she wasseeking redress for illegal eviction and the demolition of her home, wasdetained while disembarking in Jiangsu from a train from Beijing by four men inplainclothes who did not identify themselves.[83] "Theysaid I had to cooperate with their work, but they never told me what that workwas, but I knew [my detention] was because of my petitioning."[84]She subsequently spent 36 days confined to a black jail in Jiangsu.[85]One petitioner from Heilongjiang province said she had been abducted anddetained in black jails in Beijing and Heilongjiang four times since June 2006related to her efforts for redress over a land dispute. The second time she wasdetained, on October 26, 2006, she was pulled from a petition application lineat the Public Security Bureau petitioning office in Beijing by governmentofficials from her hometown. She subsequently spent 70 days in black jails in Beijing and Heilongjiang.[86]Those who were given reasons for their detention said the allegationsranged from "disrupting social order"[87] and"illegal petitioning" [88] toconcerns that their petitioning efforts would disrupt preparations for highprofile events in Beijing including the 2008 Olympic Games[89]and annual meetings of China's parliament, the National People's Congress.[90]Few resisted these abductions, recognizing that their abductors were governmentofficials and/or members of the security forces. One woman spent 22 days in ablack jail facility in a government building in southern Beijing before beingreleased in Beijing without explanation. As she told Human Rights Watch: "Ididn't resist. I was a lone woman. How could I have resisted them? If Iresisted, I would just have been beaten, so I didn't bother."[91]The majority of former black jail detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch said that their guards held them incommunicado byconfiscating their mobile phones and preventing them from contacting eitherlegal counsel or family and friends. Those procedures prevented a 54-year-old womanfrom Jiangsu province from contacting anyone outside of the black jail facilityin a Beijing hotel where she was detained from September 23, 2008, to November13, 2008.At the [hotel] entrance I was subjected to a body searchand my mobile phone, wallet and other personal items were confiscated withoutany explanation; [the guards] said that they would temporarily take care of me.I didn't want to be taken care of, but they grabbed me.[92]In three cases, interviewees told Human Rights Watch thatgovernment officials or security forces had deceived them in order to detainthem. Two of those former detainees said that they were tricked into custody byindividuals who claimed to be journalists seeking interviews about theirreasons for petitioning. "A retriever from our [home] county pretended to be ajournalist from Radio Free Asia [and] said he wanted to interview me [but] itturned out that when I went [to be interviewed], I got locked up," a 34-year-oldformer detainee from Hubei told Human Rights Watch.[93]A 40-year-old former detainee from Hubei province told Human Rights Watch thathe was the victim of a similar deception by a local government official whoabducted him by initially "pretending to be a journalist" who wanted tointerview him.[94] In thethird case, police convinced a Heilongjiang woman to accompany them from herhome on the basis that the local county chief wanted to meet her to "solve the [petitioning]problem."[95] Thepolice instead escorted her to a recently-constructed government building,where she was confined for 55 days. Her captors described this black jail as a"petitioners' school."[96]Physical Violenceagainst DetaineesViolence and its constant threat defined the experience ofmore than half the former black jail detainees interviewed by Human RightsWatch. Many petitioners bound for detention in black jail facilities are beatenand in some cases forcibly restrained in order to evoke compliance with theircaptors. A guard at the Beijing Financial Assistance Management Center,[97]better known as Majialou, has alleged that petitioners who resisttransfer are "beaten and sometimes they have their bones broken."[98]One former black jail interviewee we interviewed said thatshe was the victim of a threat of sexual violence, while in August 2009 therewere media reports of a rape of a femail petitioner at a Beijing black jail.Due to deep social stigma around sexual violence and limited prospects ofredress, such cases are likely underreported. On August 3, 2009, a 20-year-oldstudent from Anhui province detained in a Beijing black jail was reportedlyraped by one of her guards.[99]The guard fled after the rape, witnesses said. About 50detainees, including the student, broke through the wooden door and ran awayTuesday morning (August 4, 2009), taking two bloody sheets with them as evidenceof the assault. About 10 (of the detainees) went to the local police station toreport the rape, but say they were ignored.[100]A 46-year-old former detainee from Jiangsu province who wasabducted off of a Beijing street and forcibly returned to Jiangsu to spend 37days in a black jail cried with fear and frustration as she recalled herabduction during an interview with Human Rights Watch.[The abductors] are inhuman. Their car drove up to thatplace [where I was] and two people dragged me by the hair and put me into thecar. My two hands were tied up and I couldn't move. Then [after arriving backin Jiangsu] they put me inside a room where there were two women who strippedme of my clothes... [and] beat my head [and] used their feet to stomp my body.[101]Once petitioners are detainedinside black jails, they are at the mercy of government officials, securityforces and their agents. According to one Chinese legal expert who has extensivelyresearched black jails, "Physical abuse [within black jails] is widespread andoften very serious."[102] Suchabuse is at odds with both international and Chinese law regarding thetreatment of detainees.The Chinese government already has a poor record of ensuringthe rights and safety of detainees in official detention centers for criminalsuspects in which due process and government supervision should be guaranteed.Official Chinese government statistics indicate that in the first four monthsof 2009 alone, a total of 15 detainees died "unnatural deaths" in official detentioncenters.[103]Official concerns about allegations of brutality and torture in officialcriminal suspect detention centers have prompted a government decision to equipall such facilities with closed circuit television security monitors by the endof September 2009.[104] But blackjails offer no such protections or official oversight. Even the officialChinese state media has reported severe physical abuse at such facilitiesincluding the use of electric cattle prods to torture and abuse detainees.[105]Two-thirds of the former black jail detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch reported being physically abused by their captors either atthe time of their abduction, during the period of their abduction, or both:"There were absolutely no human rights, we were at the mercy of the guards [and]verbal abuse and beatings were [the black jail's] home-cooked food."[106]A 53-year-old woman in Liaoning province's Shenyang city suffered a dislocatedhip on March 7, 2007, while attempting to resist attempts of Shenyang police toforce her into a car and transport her to a black jail.[107]The woman said her abductors said they were preventing her from going to Beijing to petition during the annual meeting of China's parliament, the National People'sCongress.[108] Shewas held for nine days in a local state-owned hotel, where she was deniedaccess to medical care for her hip.[109] Oneformer detainee told Human Rights Watch that she was the victim of a knifeattack by one of her guards during her eight-day detention in a Beijing black jail in February, 2009. She told us that the guards "violently beat me andslashed my face with a knife, requiring 15 stitches."[110]Former black jail detainees told Human Rights Watch thattheir captors demanded absolute obedience and would respond to any perceivedacts of defiance with at times severe physical violence. "I was beaten [byguards] every three days...they said I didn't respect their work. I couldn'tendure it and several times considered suicide," a 42-year-old former detaineefrom Sichuan told Human Rights Watch, describing her September 25, 2008,abduction and subsequent 55 day detention in a black jail in Chengdu, Sichuanprovince.[111]In one case, a detainee's request for something as simple astoilet paper was the pretext for a "brutal beating," according to a woman who witnessedthe beating while being detained in a black jail in a government building inHeilongjiang province from August 22, 2008, to September 24, 2008.[112]Another detainee said the constant physical violence and its threat created anatmosphere of "terror" in the black jail in Hubei province where he wasdetained for more than 14 months in 2007-2008.[113]Several former black jail detainees told Human Rights Watchthat queries about the legal basis of their detention also prompted violentreactions from their guards. One Heilongjiang petitioner, detained for 12 daysin a local black jail, said her inquiries about the reasons for her detentionsparked a beating by her guards which left her unable to stand or walk.[114]The petitioner said her injuries prompted her guards to seek her release forfear that she would die while in custody at the black jail.[115]She was released to seek medical treatment outside the facility. A formerdetainee from Chongqing municipality detained in a black jail facility locatedin a Chongqing nursing home was also punished by his guards for questioning thelegality of his incarceration.I asked why they were detaining me, and as a group [theguards] came in and punched and kicked me and said they wanted to kill me. Iloudly cried for help and they stopped, but from then on, I didn't dare [riskanother beating].[116]Two of the former black jail detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch said their captors explicitly told them that physical mistreatmentof detainees was acceptable to their superiors.  A 54-year-old former detaineefrom Zhejiang province who endured several beatings during 16 days in a blackjail facility in the basement of a Beijing hotel in July 2007 said, "[Theguards] said that we come to Beijing to petition once, then they'll detain usonce, beat us once and then we won't try to come back to Beijing again."[117]Another former detainee from Jiangsu province who spent almost two months in ablack jail located in a Beijing hotel, reported that her captors had explicitinstructions on the degree of physical violence they could inflict ondetainees. "They said that their boss had instructed them that they could beatas long as they didn't break any bones."[118]Foreign correspondents who have visited black jails havealso been beaten and detained. Reuters senior correspondent Chris Buckley'sSeptember 10, 2007, visit to a Henan province black jail facility in suburban Beijing ended with him being tackled by a group of men who refused to identify themselves,but whom Buckley suspects were plainclothes police due to their clothing anddemeanor.[119] Themen kicked and punched Buckley, confiscated his notes, detained him for twohours, denied his requests to contact his employer and his embassy, andthreatened him with serious physical injury when he protested his detention.[120]Uniformed police officers who later arrived on the scene facilitated Buckley'srelease, but took no legal action against the men who had detained him andinjured his upper body.[121]Plainclothes guards at the same black jail accosted atelevision news crew from the United Kingdom's Channel 4 who visited thefacility on September 14, 2007. The guards tried to smash the team's videocamera and subsequently detained them at the facility for six hours.[122]The correspondents' detention ended only after police arrived and read a listof alleged "offenses" committed by the journalists, including "filming agovernment building without permission" and confiscated a videotape whichpolice believed held footage shot of the black jail facility.[123]Xu Zhiyong, a Beijing University of Post andTelecommunications law professor and activist against black jails in Beijing, has also been the target of violence for his involvement with petitionersimprisoned in such facilities. In a November 2008 interview with China's Economic Observer newspaper, Xu described being assaulted by plainclothes thugsapparently operating at the behest of a Beijing black jail where Xu wasattempting to secure the release of detainees.Shortly after [my arrival at the black jail], a minibussuddenly came. Three people jumped out and violently attacked the petitioners.Almost at the same time, my neck, chest and face were punched. The bare-armedguard fiercely kicked me in the knees from behind, trying to knock me down.[124]Denial of Detainees'Access to Medical TreatmentThe chronic violence and crowded, often unsanitaryconditions in black jails lead to injuries and illness for many detainees. Severalformer detainees said that facilities lacked medical practitioners and severalothers said that authorities who operated the black jails were unwilling toallow sick detainees to seek medical treatment at outside medical facilities.This denial of access to medical care is a serious violationof Chinese and international law governing the health of detainees. Both the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form ofDetention or Imprisonment and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners stipulate minimum benchmarks for detention facilities toensure the health and wellbeing of detainees. Article 45 of theConstitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees Chinese citizens "theright to material assistance...when they are ill." The Prison Law of thePeople's Republic of China also stipulates that prison authorities are obligedto provide medical examinations for all new detainees[125]and allows those authorities to grant parole to "seriously ill" prisoners whorequire medical treatment.[126]Detainees with existing medical conditions upon "admission"to black jails reported that their guards were unresponsive to their pleas formedical attention. A 40-year-old man from Hubei province detained for 9 days inMarch 2009 in a black jail located in a Beijing government building said thatauthorities provided no medical treatment for detainees.  "Who was there totake care of us? I think I could have died and they wouldn't have cared. Theydidn't take care of people who were seriously ill."[127]Other former detainees reported that black jail guards routinely dismissedtheir requests for medical attention with threats and insults. "The worse offwe were, the happier our guards were."[128]There was no medical treatment. I'm not very healthy andcombined with the disgusting conditions inside, I was sick every day, but theywouldn't give me medical treatment and wouldn't let me go to see a doctor. [Aguard] said, "You don't want to die here because your life isn't worth onecent. If I want you dead, you can die as easily as an ant."[129]In at least two instances, black jail guards also rebuffedthe efforts of detainees who tried to seek medical help for other sickdetainees. A former detainee from Heilongjiang province, detained in a blackjail located in a Beijing hotel from March 28, 2007, to April 1, 2007, saidthat her guards ignored her entreaties to provide medical treatment for afellow detainee who "had convulsions and was spitting up blood."[130]"There was one female petitioner who had blood in her urine, so we told theguards and they said that even if we died [in detention], they didn't care."[131]Several former detainees reported that their black jailcaptors also refused to provide medical treatment for injuries sustained inbeatings by their guards. For one former detainee, a 70-year-old petitionerfrom Hubei province detained in local black jails on three separate occasions fora total of around 115 days, the denial of needed medical treatment by her blackjail guards prompted desperate measures.When I was detained I had diarrhea, cough, a cold and achesin my legs, but there was no medical treatment. I was faced with a total lackof human sympathy for my suffering... [so] I decided to starve myself to death.Three days later, they sent me to a hospital.[132]A former detainee from Heilongjiang province detained fromAugust 22, 2008, to September 24, 2008, in a Heilongjiang Ministry of SocialAffairs facility which had been "completely transformed" into a full-time blackjail, said that her captors denied her medical treatment for a broken toe onher right foot. The former detainee told Human Rights Watch that the injury wasthe result of a beating by guards on August 28, 2008.[133]A 35-year-old former detainee from Hubei province who had spent a total of 183days during three separate periods of detention in local black jails from May2007 to August 2008 also reported denial of medical treatment for injuriessustained through physical abuse by her guards. "I was beaten every day and hadto slowly recover on my own. They don't give you medical treatment and don'tlet you go to a doctor."[134]Food and SleepDeprivationHuman Rights Watch research indicates that most black jailshave a simple daily routine: detainees are confined to their rooms or kept inlocked and guarded common areas of the facility where their days revolve aroundeating and sleeping.[135] Tenformer black jail detainees reported that they were victims of deliberate foodand/or sleep deprivation at the hands of their captors during their detention.The former detainees said that the black jail authorities implemented foodand/or sleep deprivation for reasons including punishment, to instilldiscipline or docility, and, in one case, as a deliberate torture method.In September 2007, a group of 30 farmers from Sichuan province went to petition in Beijing regarding a land dispute. They claimed they hadbeen abducted from Beijing on September 26, 2007, and taken to a military baseon Chengdu's Phoenix Mountain where they were alternately "tortured, threatenedand starved" until their release on December 1, 2007.[136]The abuse reportedly prompted one of the petitioners to attempt suicide"because [the black jail guards] didn't allow me to sleep or eat in order toforce me to write self-criticisms."[137]The conditions of a black jail located in a Beijing hotelcompound operated by Henan province's Nanyang city reflects the privations thatdetainees typically endure. Chris Buckley of Reuters reported, "Formerdetainees said they had been confined there unwashed for days or weeks on adiet of rice gruel, steamed bread and restaurant scraps, with beatings dealtout by teenage guards."[138]Former black jail detainees uniformly criticized the foodprovided as nutritionally inadequate. The 35-year-old former detainee fromHubei province mentioned above who was detained in local black jails for atotal of 183 days told Human Rights Watch, "Most petitioner black jails are thesame. The food is extremely bad, you don't get enough to eat [and] they oftenintentionally don't feed you or provide drinking water."[139]Another Hubei former detainee, the 70-year-old woman mentioned above who hadbeen detained in local black jails for a total of around 115 days, echoed thosesentiments. "The food was very poor. Every day a mouthful of rice, and a fewvegetables. This is how [the guards] tormented me, to weaken the state of myhealth."[140]Anothersaid, "The food was bad, and there was just enough so that people didn'tstarve."[141]A 54-year-old former detainee from Gansu province detainedin a black jail located in Beijing's Fengtai district from June 25, 2008, toJuly 4, 2008, interpreted the routine food deprivation she endured while adetainee as a deliberate form of abuse by the facility's guards. "[The guards']attitude was disgusting. The slightest lack of cooperation and they wouldn'tfeed us...they basically didn't consider petitioners as normal human beings.This was an extremely serious form of psychological abuse."[142]A 42-year-old former detainee from Shandong province said the routine fooddeprivation he suffered severely harmed his health while detained in a localblack jail from November 20, 2008, to January 7, 2009. "Regularly on Wednesdayand Friday we weren't fed and even drinking water wasn't available. My bodystarted to break down.[143]Two other former black jail detainees described food andsleep deprivation as a characteristic of the "study class" which their guardsclaimed was the facility's purpose. "This study class ...was about notproviding food, not allowing sleep, not allowing contact with family, notallowing contact with the outside and restricting our freedom," a 43-year-oldformer detainee from Jiangsu province detained in a local black jail for 36days in July and August 2008 explained.[144]Another Jiangsu former detainee, a 46-year-old woman who has been detained inlocal black jails on two separate occasions for a total of 61 days sinceOctober 2008, said the "study class" regimen of food and sleep deprivation wasdifficult to endure.They said they were going to make me "study well" and giveme "class." Every day I could only sleep three hours and they would at any timewake me in order so that I couldn't run away. They treated me that way...I washungry every day, but couldn't get enough to eat. The second time I was detainedfor 37 days...I lost 20 kilograms.[145]A 42-year-old woman from Jiangsu province detained in alocal black jail from December 3, 2008, to January 16, 2009, said that hercaptors used sleep deprivation as an "extremely inhuman" alternative tophysical abuse during her period of detention.[146]The most disturbing case of intentional sleep deprivation by black jailauthorities we learned of was reported by a 53-year-old woman from Zhejiang province detained from July 16, 2008, to October 14, 2008, in black jailfacilities in both Beijing and Zhejiang. The former detainee said that guardsin Zhejiang used extended sleep deprivation to torture a male detainee whosewife was still at large petitioning. "His wife was petitioning, but hadn't beencaught, so they picked up her husband and for four days and four nights theywouldn't let him sleep to force him to turn over his wife to them. It wasdespicable."[147]Child DetaineesThere is compelling evidence that Chinese governmentauthorities are complicit in the abduction and detention of children-peopleunder age 18[148]-inblack jail facilities across the country. Some children are abducted anddetained with a parent, while others are abducted and detained in the absenceof their parents or official guardians. This abuse was first noted in September2007 by a Reuters correspondent. He noted that "a boy aged about three" was oneof the detainees at a Beijing black jail facility in the compound of a Beijinghotel operated by Henan province's Nanyang municipal government.[149]"The father of the young boy yelled out that the two had been held there formonths."[150]Detention of children in black jail facilities entailsnumerous rights violations, including arbitrary deprivation of liberty, puttingchildren at risk by detaining them with adults who are not their parents orguardians, deprivation of education, denial of adequate nutrition andhealthcare, and risk of maltreatment or even torture. These rights areprotected by many international and Chinese laws.[151]Three former black jail detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch also reported that their fellow detainees had included children. A33-year-old former detainee from Hubei province said that she was detained fromAugust 4, 2008, to September 28, 2008, in her own private room in a Beijing hotel along with her six-year-old daughter.[152] A 52-year-oldpetitioner from Liaoning province said that one of her fellow detainees at agovernment building in Liaoning's Shenyang city, where she was detained fromMarch 4 to April 4, 2006, included "one old woman who had with her a boy ofaround 10 years of age."[153] A 36-year-oldfrom Gansu province, detained in a local hotel from September 3, 2008, toSeptember 14, 2008, noted that the facility also detained "many children, boysand girls."[154] Thisformer black jail detainee did not specify the children's ages or their lengthof detention, but said that they were also compelled to attend the facility's"study class." In those sessions, guards warned participants to stoppetitioning the local county government, and cautioned that their releasehinged on signing a guarantee that they would cease their petitioning efforts.[155]Another case of child detention in a black jail facilityuncovered by Human Rights Watch concerned a 15-year-old former detainee from Gansu province. She was detained from July 10, 2008, to September 13, 2008, whilepetitioning in Beijing on behalf of her father, who was allegedly disabled dueto a beating by a local government official.[156] The girlreported that plainclothes government officials and police, whom she recognizedfrom her home county in Gansu, abducted her off of a Beijing street, andreturned her to Gansu. She was held incommunicado for almost two months ingovernment facilities including a hospital, a home for the disabled, andfinally in a nursing home. The facilities were spartan and her fellow detaineesin the nursing home facility consisted only of five unidentified elderlyindividuals. The girl told us:[My abductors] said that our case had been circulated onthe Internet and had had a bad effect on them. They never told me how long Iwould be detained. I resisted, I didn't want them to detain me, but I wasbeaten and was squeezed into their car. I wasn't carrying anything with me butmy petitioning materials...which they didn't return to me after they searchedme. Every day there was nothing to do but sleep and eat. There was notelevision or newspapers or things like that. There were no shower facilitiesand it was impossible to wash clothes.Her age did not protect her from violent abuse by her guards:on September 11, 2008, guards beat her so severely that they knocked out one ofher teeth. Her guards released her without explanation on September 13, 2008,due to what she suspects was the end of the security operation for the 2008Beijing Olympic Games, which had focused on clearing the streets of Beijing of "undesirables" including petitioners.[157]Threats to PetitionersAlmost half of the former black jail detainees interviewedby Human Rights Watch reported having been threatened with violence or extendedincarceration during their detention, to discourage future petitioning efforts.One example of a very specific threat was related to us by a 36-year-old formerdetainee from Chongqing municipality, held from April 18, 2008, to October 23,2008, in a black jail facility located in a local nursing home. "Upon myrelease, [the guards] said if I didn't sign a 'no petitioning' guarantee,they'd put me in a nursing home until I died, cremate my remains and not letanyone know [what happened to me]"[158] A 54-year-oldformer detainee from Jiangsu province, held from September 23, 2008, toNovember 12, 2008, in a black jail located in a Beijing hotel compound, said:"I was forced to write a [no petitioning] guarantee certificate. [My captors] said'If you petition in the future, according to the guarantee certificate, we canbreak your legs.'"[159]Even if the individuals had been lawfully detained, whichwas not the case here, such threats would violate both Chinese and internationalstandards. The United Nations' Body of Principles for theProtection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment protectsdetainees from "violence, threats or methods of interrogation which impair hiscapacity of decision or his judgment."[160] And theChinese government's National Human Rights Action Plan (2008-2010) prioritizesthe development of measures to prohibit "corporal punishment, abuses, insult ofdetainees or extraction of confessions by torture[161]and obligates police and prison authorities to undertake effective measures toprohibit "abuse (and) insult of detainees."[162]A 42-year-old female former detainee from Sichuan province,held from September 25, 2008, to November 20, 2008, in a Chengdu municipalityblack jail located in a government building, was the target of an explicitthreat of sexual violence to discourage any escape attempt. "They threatened me[that if I escaped, they'd take me to the male prison and let (the inmates)take turns raping [me]."[163]Several former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watchreported that the guards also threatened violence against the former detainees'family members. One said that upon release her guards warned her that ifdetained for petitioning again, she would face imprisonment of eight to tenyears, and that the authorities would also undertake unspecified "retaliation"against her family members.[164]Another former detainee recounted much more specific in their threats to herfamily. "When they released me, those [guards]...said if I petitioned again,I'd be responsible for the death of a family member."[165]Her guards did not elaborate on that threat.Four former detainees described black jail guardsthreatening them with longer periods of incarceration under China's "re-education-through-labor" (RTL) system. RTL, which the United Nations' Special Rapporteuron Torture has recommended abolishing,[166] allowsthe police to unilaterally impose custodial sentences of up to three yearswhile depriving detainees of any due process of law and judicial oversight.[167]"The study class [guard] said 'Don't do it again. Petition again and you'll belocked up for three years,'" said a 54 year-old former detainee fromHeilongjiang province detained from March 28, 2007, to April 1, 2007, in ablack jail located in a Beijing hotel complex.[168]Theft and ExtortionNine former black jail detainees reported that they werevictims of theft and extortion at the hands of their guards. A 46-year-oldformer detainee from Anhui province detained for 24 hours in January 2009 in ablack jail facility located in a Beijing hotel compound said the guards therestole the entirety of her personal belongings. "They took everything I had onme, such as money, my petitioning materials, identification, etc., and didn'treturn any of it."[169] Internationaland Chinese standards for the care of detainees explicitly prohibit suchbehavior.[170]Former back jail detainees said their guards particularlytargeted for confiscation detainees' petitioning materials, which can includeland title deeds, copies of local court judgments, and medical reports thatconstitute crucial evidence to support petitioners' quest for legal redress.Six former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that theirpetitioner materials were not returned to them upon their release. "After wewere detained, [my] mobile phone, money and petitioner materials wereconfiscated. When we were released, my money and mobile phone were returned,but my petitioner materials were not returned," said a 40-year-old former detaineefrom Hubei province detained for nine days in March 2009 in a black jaillocated in a government building in Beijing.[171]Several former detainees also complained of guards extortingcash "fines" for alleged infractions and daily food costs during the course oftheir detention, and of guards demanding cash payments as a condition ofrelease.Two former detainees told Human Rights Watch that theircaptors demanded a 100 yuan (US$15) daily charge for meals, which one of themsaid consisted of a meager "two buns and cabbage soup without a drop of oil."[172]A 50 year-old former detainee from Zhejiang province said that during her March10, 2008, to August 19, 2008, captivity in a black jail located in the basementof a Beijing hotel, her guards imposed cash fines for failure to comply with adaily five-hour involuntary sitting exercise. "They forced us to sit on awooden bench, in the morning and afternoon for 2.5 hours [each time]. If we didn't comply,everyone would be fined and the [involuntary] sitting time extended."[173]A 42-year-old former detainee from Sichuan discovered thather release from 55 days of captivity in a Chengdu black jail hinged on a15,000 yuan (US$2,205) cash payment, allegedly to pay the "retriever" whooriginally abducted and detained her.[174] Herfamily eventually secured her release with a 5,000 yuan ($735) payment.[175]"When I was leaving, one of [theguards] said 'You won'tpetition again [because] this is the cost ofpetitioning."[176]Some black jail authorities also appear to be paid a fee foreach person they capture. A New York Times reporter who responded to acall for help in March 2009 from a petitioner from Zhejiang province detainedin a black jail located in a Beijing hotel, found his rescue attemptcomplicated by the jailers' concerns about getting paid: "Confounded by thepresence of foreign journalists, the men seemed unable to prevent Ms. Wu fromescaping, although they begged her to stay, saying that she could not leaveuntil a local county official arrived with their reward money."[177]Duration of Detentionand ReleaseBlack jail detentions are in some cases temporary, rangingfrom several hours to several days, until local government officials escortpetitioners back to black jail facilities in their home provinces.[178]Once back in their home province, the detention can extend much longer, up to14 months in one case Human Rights Watch documented.Detainees' release from black jails is usually arbitrary andunexplained. A report by Chinese Human Rights Defenders on the black jails system,based on interviews with former detainees, describes the process for release asfollows:[Detainees] can only be released if (1)their local governments, notified by those running the detention facilities,send officials to escort them home or to local (judicial) detention centers or(2) the local governments do not want to pay for their detention and agree tomonitor them and make sure they stop petitioning the government or (3) thedetainees sign a paper promising to stop petitioning, generally under duress.[179]Human Rights Watch interviews withformer detainees indicated that standards for release are not universal inblack jail facilities. A total of 8 of the 38 former black jail detainees HumanRights Watch interviewed said that their captors provided no reason for theirrelease. Another five former detainees said that their guards explicitly linkedtheir release to the elapse of what the government considered "sensitive"calendar dates, such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.VI. Relevant Internationaland Domestic Legal StandardsThe detention of petitioners is unlawful whether regardedthrough the lens of the international right to peacefully express grievances togovernment[180] or China's own law on Letters and Visits. The Chinese government's immediate obligation is toensure that all individuals detained for lawful petitioning activities arereleased immediately.Even if some persons detained in black jails have violatedsome local or national law, detaining them without legal authority or legalprocess is a serious human rights violation.  Extralegal, unacknowledgedabduction and detention by agents of the state can also constitute the crime ofenforced disappearance.The treatment of black jail detainees in many instances alsoviolates the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman, and degradingtreatment, and the affirmative obligation of officials to provide humaneconditions of detention, access to family and legal counsel, access to medicaltreatment, and protection of minors.Petitioning isProtectedThe targeting of petitioners for abduction and detention inillegal black jails violates China's Regulations on Letters and Visitsimplemented in 2005 to protect petitioners' interests. Those regulationsprotect petitioners' rights from infringement "due to overstepping or abuse ofpower"[181] andclassify retaliation against a petitioner as a criminal act.[182]Although not specifically linked to the right to petition, the Chinesegovernment's National Human Rights Action Plan (2009-2010) prioritizes an endto illegal, wrongful or prolonged detention, rehabilitation of victims of suchforms of detention, and punishment of the perpetrators:The state prohibits illegal detention by law enforcementpersonnel. Taking a suspect into custody, changing the place of custody orextending the term of detention must be done in accordance with the law.Wrongful or prolonged detention must be prevented. The state will improve themeasures of providing economic compensation, legal remedies and rehabilitation tovictims. Those who are responsible for illegal, wrongful or prolonged detentionshall be subject to inquiry and punished if found culpable.[183]Prohibition of Secret DetentionThe International Convention for the Protection of AllPersons from Enforced Disappearance ("Disappearances" Convention) prohibitssecret detention by government authorities and requires that enforceddisappearance be investigated and prosecuted as a serious international crime;indeed, when "widespread and systematic" it constitutes a crime againsthumanity under the convention and the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court.[184] China has signed neither the Rome Statute nor the "Disappearances" Convention, which hasyet to enter into force.However, many of the principlesthat the convention seeks to establish as binding law were first set out by adeclaration adopted by consensus of the UN General Assembly in a session with China's participation. The Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from EnforcedDisappearance[185]describes and bans enforced disappearance interms quite similar to the convention, stating the declaration should be "abody of principles for all States"[186] and establishes enforced disappearance as a normwithout derogation.[187]The UN WorkingGroup on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has already receiveddocumentation on enforced disappearances in China,[188] reinforcing the importance of the Chinese governmenteventually signing and ratifying the "Disappearances" Convention. The UN'sStandard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners stipulates that thoserules apply equally to "persons arrested or imprisoned without charge."[189]Chinese law also strictly defines and delimits theoperations of prisons under the Prison Law of the People's Republic of China. The Prison Law requires the establishment of a prison to be "subject to approval ofthe department of judicial administration under the State Council"[190]and defines a prison as "an organ of the state for executing criminalpunishments."[191]China's prisons are dedicated to "supervision and control over prisonersaccording to law."[192]Due Process of LawDue process of law requires that government officials orsecurity forces who arrest someone identify themselves and provide the legalbasis for arrest. Detainees are entitled to know the charges against them andto a speedy, predictable, and transparent process in which a court of law ruleson the merits of their arrest and detention. The Universal Declaration of HumanRights prohibits "arbitrary arrest (and) detention"[193]and guarantees "full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independentimpartial tribunal."[194]The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) likewise prohibits arbitrary arrest[195] andrequires that arrest and detention be "in accordance with such procedure as areestablished by law."[196] TheICCPR also requires that any individuals arrested or detained by police orsecurity forces have access "without delay" to a court hearing to determinelegality of detention and to order release of any detainee if detention isruled unlawful.[197] The UNHuman Rights Committee, which documents ICCPR compliance, has interpreted thisprovision to apply "to all deprivations of liberty, whether in criminal casesor in other cases such as, for example, mental illness, vagrancy, drugaddiction, educational purposes, immigration control, etc."[198]The necessity of due process for detainees is echoed in theUnited Nations' Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under AnyForm of Detention or Imprisonment.[199] TheUnited Nations' Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisonersstipulates a formal and transparent registration process for detaineesincluding recording of the individual's identity, reason for detention, anddate/time of admission and release.[200]The abduction and detention of Chinese citizens inextrajudicial detention facilities such as black jails are illegal underChinese law. Article 37 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates arrests must be conducted "with the approval or by decision of a people'sprocuratorate or by decision of a people's court and arrests must be made by apublic security organ." Article 38 of the Constitution prohibits "false chargeor frame-up" of any Chinese citizens. The People's Police Law of the People'sRepublic of China limits police powers of interrogation and detention strictlyto those suspected of criminal offences.[201] Policepowers of detention and arrest are tightly circumscribed by the CriminalProcedure Law of the People's Republic of China, which requires approval forarrests from the People's Procuratorate or a public court[202]as well as an arrest warrant which the police must display at the time ofarrest.[203] Policedetention cannot exceed a two-month investigation period without approval bythe People's Procuratorate.[204]Police tolerance and complicity in the illegal abduction anddetention of petitioners violates provisions of the People's Police Law of thePeople's Republic of China as well as the Law of the People's Republic of China on Administrative Penalty. The Police Law obligates Chinese police to "prevent, stopand investigate illegal and criminal activities."[205]Police who fail to do so are guilty of "dereliction of duty" and liable foradministrative sanctions and/or criminal prosecution.[206]Access to Legal Counseland Family MembersDetainees' right of access to legal counsel and to contactfamily members are also key components of the detainee rights stipulated ininternational law and instruments. The ICCPR requires authorities to allowdetainees "to communicate with counsel of his own choosing."[207]The United Nations' Body of Principles for theProtection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment requiresjudicial authorities to ensure detainees have assistance of legal counsel[208] as well as the abilityand adequate time to "communicate and consult"[209]with counsel without restriction barring "exceptionalcircumstances."[210]Detainees can not be denied access to either family members or legal counsel"for more than a matter of days"[211]and detainees are alsoentitled to communicate with and be visited by family members within"reasonable conditions and restrictions."[212]The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners also stipulates the right of detainees to "communicatewith their family and reputable friends" at regular intervals.[213]This willful obstruction of detainees' ability to contactlegal counsel and friends and family is in direct violation of the CriminalProcedure Law of the People's Republic of China, the People's Police Law of thePeople's Republic of China, and the Prison Law of the People's Republic of China. The Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that a detainees' family or work unit must benotified of the reasons for detention and place of custody within 24 hours ofdetention.[214] ThePolice Law requires the immediate notification of a detainee's family membersif detention is extended beyond 24 hours from the initial incarceration.[215]The Prison Law specifies that detainees maintain their "rights to defense,petition, complaint and accusation"[216]Minimum Standards forDetention FacilitiesBoth the Body of Principles for the Protectionof All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and the UnitedNations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners stipulate minimumbenchmarks for detention facilities to ensure the health and wellbeing ofdetainees. The Standard Minimum Rules outline a comprehensive list ofguidelines which operators of detention centers should follow, includingstandards for sleeping quarters,[217] lighting,[218] sanitaryconditions,[219] food provision,[220] and access to medical care.[221] The Body ofPrinciples for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention orImprisonment specifies the obligation of detention facilities to ensureadequate medical treatment to detainees.[222]The denial of medical care to black jail detainees violatesChinese domestic law as well as international laws and instruments. Article 45of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees Chinesecitizens "the right to material assistance...when they are ill." The Prison Lawof the People's Republic of China also stipulates that prison authorities areobliged to provide medical examinations for all new detainees[223]and allows those authorities to grant parole to "seriously ill" detainees whorequire medical treatment.[224]Prohibition of CorporalPunishment and Torture of DetaineesThe UDHR stipulates that "No one should be subjected totorture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,"[225]while the ICCPR prohibits "torture or...cruel, inhuman or degrading treatmentor punishment."[226]The Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Formof Detention or Imprisonment protects detainees from "violence, threats ormethods of interrogation which impair his capacity of decision or hisjudgment."[227] The United Nations' Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment ofPrisoners prohibits "corporal punishment...and all cruel inhuman or degradingpunishments."[228] The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment likewise requires all UN member states to "takeeffective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to preventacts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction."[229]Black jail detainees are routinely subjected to physical andpsychological abuse, and there are reports of sexual violence. These may be severeenough to meet the definition of torture under the UN Convention againstTorture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to whichChina has been party since 1988. Under this treaty;The term torture means any act by which severe pain orsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a personfor such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or aconfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or issuspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a thirdperson, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such painor suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent oracquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an officialcapacity.[230]The Convention against Torture also prohibits states from inflicting"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."[231]Physical abuse of detainees also violates the Constitutionof the People's Republic of China, the Prison Law of the People's Republic of China, and the People's Police Law of the People's Republic of China. Article 38 of the Constitutionguarantees "the personal dignity of citizens." The Police Law obligates allChinese police to "exercise their functions and powers respectively inaccordance with the provisions of relevant laws and administrative rules andregulations.[232] ThePrison Law stipulates that guards cannot humiliate detainees or violate theirpersonal safety,[233] usetorture or corporal punishment,[234] "beator connive at others to beat a prisoner,"[235] or "humiliatethe human dignity of a prisoner."[236] TheChinese government's National Human Rights Action Plan (2008-2010) prioritizesthe development of measures to prohibit "corporal punishment, abuses, insult ofdetainees or extraction of confessions by torture[237]and obligates police and prison authorities to undertake effective measures toprohibit "abuse (and) insult of detainees."[238]VII. RecommendationsTo The Government ofthe People's Republic of ChinaAdmit the existence of black jails; close them and setdetainees at liberty; and punish any person who abducts and detainsanother unlawfully or who operates or facilitates the operation of a blackjail.The Chinese government's denial of theexistence of black jails only ensures that abuses will continue and those whooperate the jails will continue to go unpunished. Elimination of black jailsshould be a high priority for the country's leaders, who should allow theproblem to be exposed through the national media to magnify deterrence, and whoshould announce swift and decisive measures to identify and locate black jails,liberate the detainees, and prosecute any individuals complicit in theabduction, detention, and abuse of persons in secret black jail facilities.Because Public Security Bureau personnelhave been complicit in the operation of black jails in Beijing and othercities, the Ministry of Public Security should consider creating an independentinvestigatory taskforce with the necessary manpower and legal heft to holdperpetrators to account.Officials should also permit and seek inputand assistance on the eradication of black jails from the United Nations'Committee against Torture and the United Nations' Working Group on ArbitraryDetention.Initiate a mass public education campaign about the legalrights of petitioners, the criminality of efforts to abduct, detain, andabuse them in black jails, and the due process rights of all criminalsuspects under Chinese law and international instruments.Chinese authorities should ensure that allofficials and members of the security forces are aware of the legal rights ofpetitioners and the illegality of extrajudicial abduction, detention, and abuseof detainees in black jails.The government should remind officials andsecurity forces of their obligations to protect the legal rights of all citizens,including petitioners, and the potentially severe legal penalties that abuse ofthose rights entails.Establish an independent commission to investigate andpublicly report on the existence of black jails and government efforts toeradicate them.The commission should investigate thefailure of the Chinese government at central, regional and local levels toenforce existing laws that outlaw black jails. The commission should be givenunfettered access to any government records on black jails, as well as theauthority to hold public hearings to collect testimony from former black jaildetainees, government officials, and members of the security forces orplainclothes thugs operating at official behest who are suspected ofinvolvement in the abduction, detention, and abuse of petitioners in black jailfacilities.The commission should invite theparticipation of domestic and international organizations, including the UnitedNations' Committee against Torture and the United Nations' Working Group onArbitrary Detention, with knowledge and expertise pertinent to investigatingand eradicating black jails.Establish a fund to compensate former black jail detaineeswho have suffered physical, sexual,  and psychological abuse by theircaptors. This fund should also be used to assist former detainees in pursuingcriminal and civil claims against their former captors.Establish a new nationwide unit within the Public SecurityBureau dedicated to investigating criminal abuses against petitioners.This special police unit should be givenlegal authority to respond to reports of abuses of the rights of petitioners aswell as the authority to enter premises which they have probable cause tobelieve are being used to house a black jail. This special police unit shouldinclude a rapid reaction squad available 24 hours a day. The government should alsocreate a special 24-hour telephone hotline for petitioners to report any abusesto the new police unit.Eliminate the linkage between local and regional governmentofficials' performance evaluations and the numbers of petitioners seekinglegal redress in Beijing and other cities.The current civil service evaluation systemeffectively punishes local and regional government officials for the presenceof petitioners from their areas in Beijing. This system encourages the use of extrajudicialmethods such as black jails to detain petitioners found in Beijing and isincompatible with the Chinese government's frequent assertions of the primacyof human rights and rule of law.Establish an independent commission to examine andevaluate the adequacy of the petitioning system in effectively identifyingand addressing citizens' grievances.The inadequacy of China's petitioning systemcontributes to China's black jail problem. The Chinese government shouldestablish an independent commission to determine whether the petitioning systemis capable of addressing the grievances of its citizens given China's rapidmodernization and unprecedented social and economic change. The commissionshould consider the abolition of the petitioning system, but only if urgentlyneeded legal reforms are enacted and implemented to enable Chinese citizens tofairly and efficiently pursue legal redress through local courts.To Governments andInternational Bodies Funding Chinese Legal Reform or Concerned with HumanRights in China, including the United States, the European Union, the WorldBank, and the Asian Development BankExpress strong concern toChinese authorities about the existence of black jails and violations ofthe rights of detainees, emphasizing that the jails violate both Chineseand international laws and standards.Demand that such abuses stop,that the perpetrators be punished, and that victims be provided with reasonablecompensation.Mobilize the United Nations'Committee against Torture to make the abolition of black jails a priorityin all future interactions with the Chinese government.Mobilize the United Nations'Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to initiate its "urgent action" procedurefor detainees in China's black jails and to undertake a field mission toChina to engage with Chinese government officials and former black jaildetainees on the problem of black jails.In all initiatives-including educational programs-aimed atcontributing to the reform of China's legal system and training of itssecurity services, make abolition of black jails a priority and raise theissue directly with Chinese officials.VI.

TheConstitution of the People's Republic of China's article 35 guarantees "freedomof speech…of association, of procession and demonstration," while article 41 ofthe Constitution guarantees the rights of Chinese citizens "to make to relevantstate organs complaints and charges."
