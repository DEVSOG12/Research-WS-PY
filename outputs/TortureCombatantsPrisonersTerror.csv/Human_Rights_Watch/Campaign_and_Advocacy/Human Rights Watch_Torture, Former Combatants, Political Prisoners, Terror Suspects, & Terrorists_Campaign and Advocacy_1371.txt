Political Prisoners Cambodia profiles 30 current and recent political prisoners in Cambodia. Twenty-one were released as Prime Minister Hun Sen attempts to regain international legitimacy after sham elections in July.Political prisoners and pre-trial detainees include members and supporters of the dissolved main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP); activists; human rights defenders; and journalists reporting for independent media outlets. Each has been detained or convicted and imprisoned for criticizing or otherwise running afoul of Hun Sen or the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP). Most recently, on August 31, 2018, Australian filmmaker James Ricketson, 69, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to six years in prison apparently for making disparaging remarks about Hun Sen and the CPP.“Cambodia has jailed a Who’s Who of prominent critics of Hun Sen and his ruling party,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “The government should immediately release all political prisoners and drop all charges, including against opposition leader Kem Sokha. Hun Sen should commit to ending the arrest of critics, which he continues to use to prop up his dictatorial rule.”Cambodia has jailed a Who’s Who of prominent critics of Hun Sen and his ruling party.Brad AdamsAsia DirectorKem Sokha, leader of the opposition CNRP, which was dissolved in 2017 by the government-controlled Supreme Court. A longtime member of parliament and human rights activist, Sokha was arbitrarily arrested on September 3, 2017 on fabricated treason charges. He was held in a remote prison near the border with Vietnam. On September 10, 2018, Sokha was released from prison and placed under house arrest. The court banned Sokha from meeting with “former officials of the Cambodian National Rescue Party … foreigners, especially those who may be involved in this case” and ordered him to “refrain from a political meeting or other political activities…” Treason charges and the threat of a long prison sentence remain.Those wrongfully convicted and imprisoned include:Chao Veasna, Poipet’s former commune council deputy chief from the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (one of two parties that combined to form the CNRP), was convicted in 2017 of incitement and intentional damage with aggravating circumstances. He was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay approximately US$15,000 in damages. The case followed a protest in Poipet in 2015 at which Veasna was not present in which gendarmes fired shots to disperse protesters and seriously beat a protester.Sam Sokha, a labor activist, was convicted in absentia in January 2018 on charges including “insulting a public official” after she threw a shoe at a CPP election billboard in April 2017. She fled to Thailand where the United Nations refugee agency granted her refugee status. In February, Thai officials forcibly returned her to Cambodia, where she was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison.Since sham elections in July 2018 in which the CPP took all 125 seats in the National Assembly, King Norodom Sihamoni has pardoned 16 political prisoners at the request of Hun Sen. Three others, who had been convicted but had not begun to serve their prison sentences, also received pardons. Although Sihamoni has the constitutional authority to issue pardons on his own, to date he has only acted upon Hun Sen’s request.Many of the released prisoners still have other charges pending against them. Hun Sen has publicly threatened the re-arrest of those released if they continue to criticize the government or fail to pay court-imposed fines related to their convictions. In one case, Hun Sen publicly stated that Kim Sok, a political commentator released on August 17 after serving 18 months in prison on charges of incitement and defamation, would be sent back to prison if he didn’t pay damages to Hun Sen of approximately US$200,000 imposed at the time of his conviction. After his release, Kim Sok said he would continue to speak out against the government and in favor of democracy. On August 28, a Phnom Penh judge issued a summons for Kim Sok to appear on September 14 on second charges of defamation and incitement.“The threat of being sent back to prison on other charges shows that the recent releases are just a piece of political theater and does not represent any change in Hun Sen’s approach to critics,” Adams said. “Kim Sok is being threatened with being sent back to prison simply for saying he would continue to criticize the government.”June 27, 2018Cambodia’s Dirty DozenA Long History of Rights Abuses by Hun Sen’s GeneralsDownload the full report in EnglishCambodia’s Criminal Code includes criminal offenses that seriously undermine the right to freedom of expression, such as criminal defamation, insulting government officials, discrediting judicial decisions, and a newly enacted lese majeste law. Since 2017, the government has also passed several new laws that have further restricted the rights to freedom of expression and association.Cambodia has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which enshrines the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. Cambodian authorities routinely misuse the courts, which lack judicial independence, to target members of the political opposition, civil society activists, and journalists, Human Rights Watch said. Trials, particularly those resulting from politically motivated charges, systematically violate the fair trial rights of defendants.“Cambodia’s trading partners and donors should tell the government that it must stop harassing and prosecuting critics and immediately release those unjustly held,” Adams said. “They need to make it clear to Hun Sen that it will not be business as usual so long as the government is holding political prisoners.”Political Prisoners in CambodiaTotal as of September 10, 2018: 10 political prisoners serving prison sentences or held in pre-trial detention. Another 16 individuals have recently been released from prison, four of whom still face politically motivated criminal charges.Venerable Horn Sophanny, 25Click to expand ImageVenerable Horn Sophanny© Radio Free AsiaVenerable Horn Sophanny is an activist member of the Independent Monk Network for Social Justice, a group led by monk But Buntenh.

On March 23, 2018, the Pailin Provincial Court convicted  him of inciting the commission of a felony (article 495 of the Criminal Code) and insulting a public official (article 502). The court sentenced him to one year in prison with a fine of eight million riels (US$2,000).Chao Veasna, 54Click to expand ImageChao Veasna© LICADHOChao Veasna, an ethnic Khmer Krom, was a Poipet commune council deputy chief from the Candlelight Party (renamed from the Sam Rainsy Party after the law changed to ban the use of a person’s name in the name of a political party). During an anti-government protest outside the Poipet customs office in May 2015 at which Veasna was not present, military police fired warning shots to disperse protesters and seriously beat one protester. With commune elections scheduled for June 2017, on February 16, 2017, a Banteay Meanchey Provincial Court investigating judge questioned Veasna for four hours and sent him to Banteay Meanchey provincial prison in connection with the May 2015 protest. Veasna was charged with inciting the commission of a felony (articles 494 and 495 of the Criminal Code) and, as an accomplice, with intentional damage with aggravating circumstances (general aggravation and in relation to status of the victim) (articles 29, 410, 411 and 412), as well as with intentional damage with aggravating circumstances (using dangerous means and causing injury) (articles 413 and 414). On June 7, 2018, the Provincial Court convicted and sentenced Veasna to five years’ imprisonment.

On June 9, 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court charged Ricketson with espionage (article 446 of the Criminal Code), claiming he gathered information for a foreign power that could damage national security. After a seven-day trial, on August 31, 2018, the Phnom Penh Court convicted him of espionage (articles 439 and 446) and sentenced him to six years in prison.Ismail Pin Osman, 45Click to expand ImageIsmail Pin Osman© LICADHOIsmail Pin Osman was a reserve National Assembly candidate for the CNRP in Kampong Cham province in the 2013 national election.

His post compared the king unfavorably to Cambodia’s former kings. On May 20, 2018, the police in Chikreng district, Kampong Kdey commune, Siem Reap province, arrested Samphy and questioned him. The investigating judge of the Siem Reap Provincial Court charged Samphy the same day with “insult of the king” (article 437 bis of Cambodia’s Criminal Code), which carries a punishment of up to five years in prison.

Eight Prime Minister bodyguard unit officers led a contingent of more than 100 police to carry out the arrest. In a highly unusual move, authorities immediately sent him to the remote Trapeang Phlong prison (Correctional Center 3), in Tbaung Khmom province near the border with Vietnam. On the basis of a false allegation that he had committed a crime in flagrante delicto (caught in the act of committing a crime), the National Assembly stripped him of his parliamentary immunity.On September 5, 2017, prosecutors charged him with conspiring with a foreign power (article 443 of the Criminal Code). If convicted, he faces 15-30 years in prison. Sokha’s arrest came after Hun Sen accused him of plotting to topple the government with support from the United States based on a highly edited videotape of a speech Sokha gave in Australia in 2013. On May 26, 2018, the court summoned eight individuals – including members of nongovernmental organizations – to appear for questioning as witnesses in Sokha’s case.On April 19, 2018, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its Opinion No. 9/2018 declared Kem Sokha’s detention “arbitrary” and “politically motivated.”Sokha had been previously convicted in 2016 on politically motivated charges for failure to appear as a witness against two CNRP parliamentary members detained in a fabricated prostitution case. The court sentenced him to five months in prison, but he remained under de facto house arrest, surrounded by CNRP supporters and police outside CNRP headquarters until December 2016, when he received a royal pardon.On September 10, 2018, Sokha was released from prison and placed under house arrest. The court order specifically bans Sokha from meeting with “former officials of the Cambodian National Rescue Party… foreigners, especially those who may be involved in this case” and orders him to “refrain from a political meeting or other political activities…” Treason charges remain in force. If Sokha conducts any political activities or misses a court appearance he will be sent back to prison.Recently Released Political PrisonersUon Chhin, 49, released on bail August 21, 2018Click to expand ImageUon Chhin© LICADHOUon Chhin, a former Radio Free Asia (RFA) cameraman, was arrested on November 14, 2017, in Phnom Penh, on the same day as his colleague Yeang Sothearin.

Prosecutors filed baseless espionage charges, accusing Chhin and Sothearin of illegally setting up a broadcast studio with the purpose of continuing to file news reports for RFA’s headquarters in Washington, DC. On November 18, 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court formally charged Chhin with supplying a foreign state with information prejudicial to Cambodia’s national defense (article 445 of the Criminal Code).

The charges stemmed from an interview he gave to Radio Free Asia in which he alluded to the alleged involvement of the ruling CPP in the murder of prominent political commentator Kem Ley in July 2016. On August 10, 2017, a court convicted Sok of defamation (article 305 of the Criminal Code) and inciting the commission of a felony (articles 494 and 495) and sentenced him to 18 months in prison and a fine of 8 million riels (US$2,000) to be paid to the government and 800 million riels ($200,000) in damages to be paid to the CPP.

Authorities arrested her on August 15, 2016, during a peaceful protest. On August 22, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Vanny and Bov Sophea, a fellow community member, of insulting a public official (article 502 of the Criminal Code) and sentenced them both to the six days they had already served in pre-trial detention.The authorities then restarted long-dormant politically motivated charges against Vanny. On September 19, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Vanny and three other Boeung Kak lake community members (Kong Chantha, Bo Chhorvy, and Heng Mom) for obstructing a public official with aggravating circumstances and insulting a public official (articles 502 and 504) and sentenced them to six months in prison. The charges stemmed from their participation in a protest in November 2011 outside the Phnom Penh municipality office, where they demanded justice in the Boeung Kak land dispute. On February 23, 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld their conviction and prison sentence. On December 8, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed, though the Supreme Court’s presiding judge left the enforcement of the prison sentence to the discretion of the prosecutor, so none of the four women have yet served their prison sentence.For Vanny’s participation in a protest outside Hun Sen’s house in March 2013, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted her on February 23, 2017 of intentional violence with aggravating circumstances (article 218) and sentenced her to two and a half years in prison and a fine of 5 million riels (approximately US$1,250). The court also ordered Vanny to pay compensation of 9 million riels (approximately $2,250) to two security guards, the plaintiffs who alleged injury. The court denied consideration of video evidence showing that the two security guards were responsible for the violence, in a trial that otherwise did not meet international fair trial standards. On August 8, 2017, the Phnom Penh Court of Appeal upheld the ruling, as did the Supreme Court on February 8, 2018.On August 23, 2018, Tep Vanny was released after a royal pardon granted by King Norodom Sihamoni. Four days later, on August 27, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted her and five fellow community members of making death threats related to a community dispute. Although the complainant retracted her complaint, the prosecutor and investigating judge continued to pursue the case. The court sentenced all six to suspended six-month prison sentences; the suspension is conditional for five years, during which the sentence may be enforced against any of the defendants who are found guilty of having committed a crime.Sourn Serey Ratha, 44, released on August 23, 2018Click to expand ImageSourn Serey Ratha© Radio Free AsiaSourn Serey Ratha, a dual Cambodian-US citizen, is the founder and president of the Khmer People Power Movement (KPPM) and later the Khmer Power Party (KPP).

On August 14, authorities charged Ratha with inciting military personnel to disobedience (article 471 of the Criminal Code), demoralizing the army (article 472) and inciting the commission of a felony (articles 494). On August 25, 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Ratha and sentenced him to five years in prison and fined him 10 million riels (US$2,500). On October 12, 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction. On May 18, 2018, the Supreme Court also did.The government has labelled Ratha’s KPPM party a terrorist group. While in self-imposed exile in 2015, a court convicted Ratha in absentia for endangering government institutions or violating the integrity of the national territory (article 453) and of using force or violence to deter eligible voters from voting (article 124 of the Law on Election of Members of the National Assembly). The court sentenced him to seven years in prison. Upon Hun Sen’s request, King Sihamoni pardoned Ratha on July 10, 2015, thereby allowing him to return to Cambodia without fear of imprisonment. In March 2015, the Ministry of Interior gave permission to Ratha to form a political party to contest in the elections: Ratha formed the Khmer Power Party.In December 2015, Ratha filed a complaint against Foreign Minister Hor Namhong for defamation and incitement because the minister had failed to write an official apology letter, recanting his allegation that his KPP party had committed terrorist acts.On May 15, 2018, Ratha posted a letter on his Facebook page, apologizing to Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Royal Armed Forces and seeking a pardon.

He was arrested on his return to Cambodia on April 11, 2016, on the basis of a post he made on Facebook that included his findings on the politically contentious dispute. Although covered by parliamentary immunity, prosecutors used a loophole in the law – permitting prosecutions for crimes in flagrante delicto (caught in the act), to bring him to trial. The Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Sam An on October 10, 2016 of inciting the commission of a felony (article 495 of the Criminal Code) and inciting racial discrimination (article 496) and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison.
