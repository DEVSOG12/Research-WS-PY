A new Human Rights Watch report released on Tuesday, “Double Jeopardy: CIA Renditions to Jordan,”confirms these conclusions, describing how detainees held by the GID were subjected to brutal beatings and threats of rape, and were concealed from representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.Reversing the SIAC’s earlier ruling in the Othman case, the court held that if Othman were deported, evidence obtained by the torture of detainees in GID custody would likely be used in his trial. The ruling essentially disregards Jordanian promises that there would be a fair trial, even though the court did not appear to consider it necessary on the facts of the case to assess the reliability of the specific UK-Jordanian “memorandum of understanding” in question.“Until GID stops torturing, promises of humane treatment and fair trial for a national security suspect are not credible,” Hall said. “Jordanian assurances are a mere legal nicety.”In another ruling, the court blocked the deportation of two Libyans, known only as “DD” and “AS,” by upholding an April 2007 SIAC ruling that the men would be at risk of torture and a “complete” denial of a fair trial if returned to Libya. The two are alleged to be members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an armed opposition group whose aim is the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi.The court ruled that the SIAC did not err by determining that Colonel al Qadhafi could not be relied upon to abide by the agreement with the British government to treat the men humanely.Human Rights Watch has documented torture and other ill-treatment in both Jordan and Libya. “Double Jeopardy,” the new Human Rights Watch report, documents how the GID served as a proxy jailer and abusive interrogator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 2001 until at least 2004. It demonstrates how the assurances that the US claims to receive when it transfers suspects to foreign custody were ineffective. In 2006, Human Rights Watch documented more recent cases of torture in Jordan’s GID in a report titled “Suspicious Sweeps: The General Intelligence Department and Jordan’s Rule of Law Problem”. Human Rights Watch also submitted an expert affidavit in the Othman SIAC proceedings arguing that the assurances contained in the UK-Jordan “memorandum of understanding” were not an effective safeguard against torture.In 2006, Human Rights Watch also released a detailed report on human rights conditions in Libya, “Words to Deeds: The Urgent Need for Human Rights Reform,”which documented serious allegations of torture. Torture is a crime in Libya, but 15 out of 32 people Human Rights Watch interviewed in Libya’s prisons said security authorities had tortured them during interrogations in recent years.“National self-interest will almost always trump human rights protection,” Hall said. “That is a key reason why brokering unenforceable promises of humane treatment is not an effective way to protect people from torture.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia Middle East/North Africa United Kingdom Jordan LibyaTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism Torture Detention without TrialMore ReadingOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsOctober 19, 2022ReportUkraine: Russian Forces Tortured Izium DetaineesReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsNovember 3, 2021ReportDismantling DetentionInternational Alternatives to Detaining ImmigrantsMore ReadingOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsOctober 19, 2022ReportUkraine: Russian Forces Tortured Izium DetaineesMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
