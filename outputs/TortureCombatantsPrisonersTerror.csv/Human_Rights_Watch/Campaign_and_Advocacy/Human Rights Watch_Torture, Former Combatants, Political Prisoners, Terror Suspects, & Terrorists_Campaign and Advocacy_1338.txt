The letter was released by Yemeni authorities in April 2004.Al-Hila sent subsequent letters to his family from Afghanistan via the International Committee of the Red Cross and, most recently, from Guantanamo.The al-Hila case is not unique.Other detainees captured outside of Afghanistan, in non-combat situations, have been brought to Guantanamo without criminal law protections.Human Rights Watch said that six Algerians held in Bosnia, for instance, were transferred to U.S. officials in January 2002 (despite a Bosnian high court order to release them) and were sent to Guantanamo.The administration has detained several other suspects outside of Afghanistan and held them as “enemy combatants.”“The Bush administration continues to believe that by invoking the word ‘terror’ it can detain anyone in any corner of the world without any oversight,” said Sifton. “Yet all these cases do is suggest that the United States has no commitment to legal principles.Turning your back on the law is not the way to stop terrorism.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa United States EgyptTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism Detention without Trial GuantanamoMore ReadingSeptember 10, 2004News ReleaseU.S.: Investigate 'Ghost Detainees'ReportsNovember 3, 2021ReportDismantling DetentionInternational Alternatives to Detaining ImmigrantsFebruary 11, 2020ReportKidnapped by ISISFailure to Uncover the Fate of Syria’s MissingMore ReadingSeptember 10, 2004News ReleaseU.S.: Investigate 'Ghost Detainees'Most ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
