After Taylor was taken into US custody when he tried to enter Miami in March, Human Rights Watch pressed for him to be investigated under never-before-applied US federal laws that make it a crime to commit torture and war crimes abroad. We also submitted a memorandum to the Department of Justice detailing Taylor’s serious crimes. Chuckie Taylor’s unit is alleged to have committed torture, including various violent assaults, beating people to death, rape, and burning civilians alive. These first-ever charges for torture committed abroad are a crucial first step by the US government to ensure long-awaited justice for the victims of Taylor’s crimes.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAfrica United States LiberiaTopicInternational Justice TortureMore ReadingOctober 5, 2022Q & AFrance’s Trial for Atrocities Committed in LiberiaOctober 5, 2022News ReleaseFrance: Liberia Atrocity TrialReportsMarch 22, 2022Report“I Only Need Justice”Unlawful Detention and Abuse in Unauthorized Places of Detention in UgandaFebruary 5, 2020ReportDeported to DangerUnited States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and AbuseMore ReadingOctober 5, 2022Q & AFrance’s Trial for Atrocities Committed in LiberiaOctober 5, 2022News ReleaseFrance: Liberia Atrocity TrialMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
