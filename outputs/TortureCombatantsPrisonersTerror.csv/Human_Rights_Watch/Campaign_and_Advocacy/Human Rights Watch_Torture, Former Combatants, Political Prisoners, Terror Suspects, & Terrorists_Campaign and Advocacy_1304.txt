In December, however, the government dashed hopes that it would release Sharipov under a presidential amnesty, despite international pressure to do so. Yesterday marked the five-month anniversary of his conviction.Sharipov was arrested on May 29. During the first days of his detention, arresting officers threatened Sharipov with physical violence, including rape with a bottle. In a letter smuggled out of prison, Sharipov confirmed that he was tortured. Until his trial on August 8, Sharipov had strenuously denied all charges. At the trial, however, Sharipov waived his right to counsel, declared his intention to plead guilty on all charges, and asked that the only outside observer to the proceedings—his mother—be removed from the courtroom, all of which gave rise to fears that his actions were coerced. Human Rights Watch is calling for an independent review of all the charges against Sharipov.On August 13, the Tashkent City Court convicted Sharipov on charges of homosexual conduct (article 120 of the Uzbek Criminal Code), sex with a minor (article 128) and involving minors in “antisocial behavior” (article 127) and sentenced him to five and a half years in prison, reduced on appeal in September to four years. Sharipov arrived at that hearing with visible injuries to his face, raising fears that he was beaten in custody. Sharipov remains in prison, where he is at risk of torture and mistreatment.Last month Human Rights Watch submitted a petition—signed by more than 650 people from around the world—to Uzbek President Islam Karimov, calling for the repeal of article 120.“This is a Stalin-era sodomy law that provides a means to retaliate against dissenters, to invade the privacy and dignity of adults, and to promote invidious discrimination and hatred,” said Denber. “Sharipov’s case shows how easily sodomy laws can be used to stigmatize and repress activists.”Article 120 violates basic human rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Uzbekistan ratified in 1996. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the Covenant, has found that laws punishing adult consensual homosexual acts violate the Covenant’s guarantees of non-discrimination and privacy and has held that sexual orientation is a status protected from discrimination by articles 2 and 26 of the Covenant.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia UzbekistanTopicLGBT Rights TortureMore ReadingOctober 25, 2022News ReleaseRussia: Appeal in Trumped-Up Chechnya ConvictionOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsReportsDecember 11, 2018ReportNo SupportRussia’s “Gay Propaganda” Law Imperils LGBT YouthOctober 12, 2017ReportIn CustodyPolice Torture and Abductions in TurkeyMore ReadingOctober 25, 2022News ReleaseRussia: Appeal in Trumped-Up Chechnya ConvictionOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
