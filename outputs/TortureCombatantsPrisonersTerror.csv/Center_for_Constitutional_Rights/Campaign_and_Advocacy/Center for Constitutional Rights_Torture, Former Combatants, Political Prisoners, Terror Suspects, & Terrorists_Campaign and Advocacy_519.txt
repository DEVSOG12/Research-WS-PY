Ashcroft et al Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: January 22, 2004Current Status On June 14, 2010, the Supreme Court denied Mr. Arar's petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' en banc decision dismissing his case, ending his case in U.S. courts.  Mr. Arar has continued his efforts to seek accountability for those complicit in his torture; in September 2015, Canada announced charges against Syrian intelligence officer Col. George Salloum, who tortured Mr. Arar.Our Team:Maria LaHoodKatherine GallagherJules LobelDavid ColeBarbara OlshanskySteven Macpherson WattKatherine GallagherMaria LaHoodCo-Counsel DLA Piper US LLPClient(s) Maher ArarJanuary 4, 2008Case Description Arar v. Ashcroft was a federal lawsuit challenging the rendition to torture of Canadian citizen Maher Arar by U.S. government officials. Mr. Arar was detained at JFK airport in September 2002 while on his way home to Canada from abroad. He was interrogated, detained for two weeks, denied access to a court and meaningful access to counsel, and secretly rendered to Syria where he was tortured and held in a grave-like underground cell for over ten months. He was never charged with a crime.   Mr. Arar’s lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Attorney General John Ashcroft, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and several U.S. immigration officials for violating his constitutional right to due process and the Torture Victim Protection Act. Mr. Arar alleged that the officials violated his Fifth Amendment rights by conspiring to subject him to arbitrary detention and torture in Syria and by blocking his access to court to ensure that he could not stop them.The U.S. government official defendants challenged the suit, claiming that even if Mr. Arar’s allegations were true, he had no judicial remedy. The U.S. government also asked that the court dismiss the case, arguing it would expose “state secrets” and harm national security. In 2006, Judge Trager dismissed Mr. Arar’s claims, finding that “national security” and “foreign policy” considerations prevented him from holding U.S. officials liable. Mr. Arar appealed this decision to a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the dismissal 2-1 in June 2008, agreeing with the lower court that Mr. Arar’s claims would interfere with national security.  In an extremely rare move, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Mr. Arar’s appeal would be reheard by the full active court in December 2008. On November 2, 2009, the full Court of Appeals dismissed the case 7-4, concluding that in cases of extraordinary rendition, it is not the court’s role to decide whether U.S. officials can be held accountable, because of foreign policy, national security, and secrecy concerns. In a strongly worded dissent, Judge Guido Calabresi wrote, “I believe that when the history of this distinguished court is written, today’s majority decision will be viewed with dismay.”For more information, read CCR's factsheet and report on his rendition and watch Mr. Arar speak about his experience.Case FilesReply Brief in Support of Petition for Certiorari Petitioner’s Request to Lodge Letter from Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Letter from Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Opposition by U.S. Government and Ashcroft Opposition by Thompson, Mueller, Ziglar, Blackman, and McElroy Amicus Brief of the Bar of England and Wales Human Rights Committee and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights Amicus Brief of Canadian and International Human Rights Orgs and Scholars Amicus Brief of Current and Former U.N.

George Salloum to be tried for the torture of Maher Arar. The news follows a 2005 complaint launched with the RCMP by Mr. Arar seeking Salloum’s prosecution. Mr. Arar’s wife, Monia Mazigh, reads a statement on his behalf: "It is my hope that Col. George Salloum will be found alive, arrested, and will be extradited to Canada to face Canadian justice…Since I launched my complaint in 2005, I gave the RCMP investigating team, during the many interviews I had with them, the information they needed to advance their investigation.” Mazigh says, "People wouldn't even admit he was tortured. This is a clear message to my husband — and to whoever denied that torture happened — that this is real and that you cannot commit torture [with] impunity. It is symbolic, but at the same time, it is personal."Related ResourcesRCMP charges Syrian officer in Maher Arar torture caseApril 5, 2015Former CIA counterrorism officer reveals U.S. knew Mr. Arar was innocentApril 5, 2015Former CIA counterrorism officer reveals U.S. knew Mr. Arar was innocentIn an article in the Canadian Press, John Kiriakou says “I can tell you that a lot of people inside the CIA objected to this.” He continues: “I remember hearing some of the conversations – that, ‘This is the wrong guy, this is a mistake.’ And then one officer in particular (was) saying, ‘No, this is not the wrong guy.

Canadian investigators, with U.S. cooperation, exhaustively investigated Mr. Arar, and found no information that could implicate Mr. Arar in terrorist activities. The Commission also finds no evidence that Canadian officials acquiesced in the U.S. decision to detain and remove Mr. Arar to Syria, but that it is very likely that the U.S. relied on inaccurate and unfair information about Mr. Arar that was provided by Canadian officials.Related FilesAnalysis & RecommendationsFactual Background: Volume IFactual Background: Volume IIAddendum (released in 2007)September 12, 2006CCR files notice of appeal in Second Circuit Court of AppealsSeptember 12, 2006CCR files notice of appeal in Second Circuit Court of AppealsAugust 17, 2006Final judgment is enteredAugust 17, 2006Final judgment is enteredJuly 14, 2006CCR files notice of intent not to repleadJuly 14, 2006CCR files notice of intent not to repleadCCR files notice of intent not to replead, but to instead stand on the allegations of his complaint, and therefore appeal the entire February 16 order.July 5, 2006Judge Trager denies Rule 54(b) motion for permission to immediately appealJuly 5, 2006Judge Trager denies Rule 54(b) motion for permission to immediately appealApril 3, 2006CCR files motion requesting permition to appealApril 3, 2006CCR files motion requesting permition to appealCCR and co-counsel DLA Piper US LLP file a motion requesting that they be permitted to immediately appeal Mr. Arar's "rendition" claims to the Second Circuit without waiting for resolution of his U.S. detention claim.Related FilesNotice of MotionFebruary 16, 2006District court dismisses caseFebruary 16, 2006District court dismisses caseJudge David Trager of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismisses Mr. Arar's claims against U.S. government officials for "rendering" him to Syria to be tortured and arbitrarily detained.Related FilesOpinionApril 4, 2005Defendants file reply in support of their invocation of state secrets privilegeApril 4, 2005Defendants file reply in support of their invocation of state secrets privilegeRelated FilesReply in Support of Motion to Dismiss re: state secretsMarch 15, 2005CCR files responseMarch 15, 2005CCR files responseCCR argues that Mr. Arar could prove his case without privileged information, and even if such information were necessary to establish a defense, procedural safeguards could protect it.March 14, 2005Defendants file reply in support of motion to dismiss U.S. government from caseMarch 14, 2005Defendants file reply in support of motion to dismiss U.S. government from caseRelated FilesReply in Support of Motion to DismissJanuary 18, 2005U.S. government moves to dismiss caseJanuary 18, 2005U.S. government moves to dismiss caseThe government asserts the “state secrets” privilege, claiming that the reasons Mr. Arar was deemed a member of Al Qaeda and sent to Syria, instead of Canada, are “state secrets”.Related FilesMemo in Support of Motion to Dismiss re: state secretsJanuary 14, 2005CCR files opposition to motion to dismissJanuary 14, 2005CCR files opposition to motion to dismissRelated FilesMemo of Law in Opposition of Motions to DismissSeptember 17, 2004Defendants file motion to dismissSeptember 17, 2004Defendants file motion to dismissRelated FilesMemo in Support of Motion to DismissJanuary 22, 2004CCR files lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Arar in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New YorkJanuary 22, 2004CCR files lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Arar in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New YorkDefendants include Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, as well as several U.S. immigration officials.Press ReleaseJohn Ashcroft Sued by CCR for TortureRelated ResourcesVIDEO: Maher Arar: JFK to Syria - No More SecretsRelated FilesComplaintComplaint with ExhibitsLast modified:August 11, 2021Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesThe 9/11 EffectTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
