Obama / Khan v. Gates / United States v. KhanAt a GlanceDate Filed: September 29, 2006Current Status Khan v. Obama and Khan v. Gates have been dismissed or withdrawn without a ruling on the legality of Khan’s detention. In February 2012, Khan was charged by military commission with certain offenses under the Military Commissions Act of 2009. Khan pled guilty and was sentenced on October 29, 2021. He is due to be released in February 2022.Our Team:J. Wells DixonShayana KadidalShayana KadidalJ. Wells DixonCo-Counsel Jenner & Block LLP; Military Commissions Defense Organization (U.S. v. Khan)Client(s) Majid KhanOctober 1, 2007Case Description CCR has represented Majid Khan in three cases: Khan v. Obama, a habeas corpus petition filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; Khan v. Gates, a petition for review under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; and United States v. Khan, a military commission prosecution at Guantánamo Bay.CCR’s representation of Khan is part of our efforts to end indefinite detention without charge or trial and close Guantánamo and to ensure accountability for U.S. torture.  We were among the first attorneys to work on behalf of Guantánamo prisoners, and we will continue to do so until the prison is closed.Majid Khan is unique among Guantánamo prisoners in two important respects. First, a citizen of Pakistan, he has long had political asylum status in the United States and other substantial ties to this country. He grew up outside of Baltimore, Maryland, graduated from Owings Mills High School, and lived and worked in the area. He is married and has a young daughter he has never met. Several of his other family members are U.S. citizens and still live near Baltimore.  Second, in March 2003, Khan was captured and forcibly disappeared by the United States. There is no serious dispute that he was abducted, imprisoned, and tortured by U.S. officials at secret overseas “black sites” operated by the Central Intelligence Agency before he was transferred to Guantánamo Bay in September 2006. Nor is there any serious dispute that Majid Khan’s detention and interrogation violated U.S. and international law.Majid Khan’s torture is described at length in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on the CIA’s post-9/11 detention and interrogation program, key findings of which were released on December 9, 2014. The report describes some of the methods inflicted on Majid Khan, which were deliberately and systematically applied to cause him severe physical and psychological harm, but which produced no actionable intelligence. The report states that Majid Khan was subjected to torture methods such as sleep deprivation and nudity. The report also states that he was subjected to “rectal feeding,” a form of rape. In May 2015, CCR obtained declassified notes describing some of Khan’s personal recollections of his experience in secret detention, including additional details of his torture such as the fact that he was waterboarded and threatened with harm to himself and his family.  In February 2012, Khan was charged and pled guilty to various offenses before a military commission at Guantanamo.  He pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the Convening Authority for Military Commissions.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on October 28-29, 2021.  Given his longstanding cooperation, Khan will conclude his military commission sentence in February 2022, after which he will be transferred from Guantánamo Bay.In its initial representation of Khan, CCR had to fight for more than a year just to meet with our client, as the government objected because of the “unique circumstances” of his case, which CCR argued was an attempt to conceal illegal conduct and acts that would embarrass the United States.  Because Khan was initially denied access to counsel in his habeas case, Khan v. Obama, he filed a petition for review under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, Khan v. Gates.Case FilesKhan_Clemency_Letter .pdf Statement by Majid Khan Transcript Ruling - Government Motion toReconsider AE 033K Ruling - Government Motion toReconsider AE 047K Order - Defense Motion for Pretrial Punishment Credit and Other Related Relief Order - Defense Motion for Appropriate Relief Defense Motion for Pretrial Punishment Credit and Other Related Relief - Part 1 Defense Motion for Pretrial Punishment Credit and Other Related Relief - Part 2 Defense Motion for Pretrial Punishment Credit and Other Related Relief - Part 3 Defense Motion for Pretrial Punishment Credit and Other Related Relief - Part 4 CVT Amicus Brief NIMJ Amicus Brief Al Baluchi Amicus Brief Defense Motion to Compel Production of Witnesses Order - Defense Motion to Compel Production of Witnesses Order - Defense Motion for Partial Reconsideration Ruling Defense Motion to Compel Brady material Ruling Denying Brady motion Ruling - Defense Motion for Reconsideration Ruling - Defense Second Motion for Reconsideration Modification to Pretrial Agreement Transcript Government Motion with New Classification Guidance re: CIA Prisoners Pretrial Agreement Appendix to Pretrial Agreement Transcript of Proceedings Government Notice of Filing Unprotected Factual Return Court Order Denying Motion for Expedited Judgment Court Order designating factual returns as protected Court Order to Stay the Case Khan's Notice of Request to Stay the Case Government's Notice of Filing of Opposition to Motion for Expedited Judgment Court's Memorandum Opinion Notice of Filing of Motion for Expedited Judgment Government Response to Khan Supplemental Memo Petitioners' Joint Memo in Response to Government Memo re: detention authority Majid Khan's Supplemental Memo Government's Notice of service of unclassified, protected factual return Government Memo Re: Detention Authority Relative to Guantánamo Detainees Government Notice of Filling Classified Return Khan Protective Order Gutierrez Declaration Dixon Declaration Khan v.
