Obama Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: October 1, 2006Current Status On April 16, 2016, Ba Odah was released to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Our Team:Omar FarahClient(s) Tariq Ba OdahMay 17, 2013Case Description Ba Odah v. Obama was a habeas corpus petition on behalf of Tariq Ba Odah, a Yemeni man who was detained at Guantánamo without charge from 2002-2016. The Obama administration cleared him for release in 2009, but, like other cleared Yemenis at the prison, he remained arbitrarily detained solely because of his citizenship. He spent one-third of his life in Guantánamo.Not long after he arrived in Guantánamo, Ba Odah began his hunger strike to protest his indefinite detention without charge. He reports that through the years the crackdown from the Guantánamo prison administration was so brutal that he was unable to maintain his peaceful strike. Periodically he would be forced to give it up before resuming it again. In 2007, however, he resolved to begin what became one of the longest running hunger strikes at Guantánamo.As a result of his peaceful hunger strike, Ba Odah was force-fed daily, a practice widely condemned as torture. Twice a day, guards strapped him to a restraint chair, forced a rubber tube down his nose, and pumped a liquid dietary supplement into his stomach. Guantánamo prison authorities also kept him in solitary confinement because they viewed his strike as “non-compliance.” He was only permitted to be outside of his cell for 2-4 hours per day. Unfortunately, he was often too weak to walk out of his cell and take advantage of this time. He had very little human contact. At one point Ba Odah weighed 160 pounds; his strike caused his weight to drop as low as 75 pounds. For Tariq, protesting by hunger striking was the only way to communicate to those of us who have our freedom what it means to be unjustly detained, to be put in a cell for over a decade without charge.“A captive does not possess any realistic means to send his messages to the world other than to strike. . . Freedom should be much more precious for the human being than all the desires on earth. And we should never give it up regardless of how expensive the price may be.” — Tariq Ba Odah, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, April 2013Ba Odah was released to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on April 16, 2016, and looks forward to rebuilding his life as a free man.Case FilesReply to Goverment Opposition to Motion for Release Exhibit 1: Farah Declaration Exhibit 2: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Jess Ghannam Exhibit 3: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Rami Bailony Exhibit 4: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Sondra Crosby Government Opposition to Motion for Judgment Exhibit 1 to Government Opposition Exhibit 2 to Government Opposition Memo in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Record Farah Declaration in Support of Motion Ghannam Declaration in Support of Motion Bailony Declaration in Support of Motion Crosby Declaration in Support of Motion Exhibit--DOJ Letter (Nov. 20, 2014) Order Dismissing Habeas PetitionCCR Submission on US Compliance with the UN Convention Against TortureBa Odah Status Report January 2014 Written Summary of CCR Presentation Ba Odah Status Report July 2012 Order Granting Stay of Habeas PetitionFactsheet~Tariq Ba Odah.pdf Order Granting Stay of Habeas Petition Ba Odah Status Report July 2012 Ba Odah Status Report July 2013 Ba Odah Status Report January 2014 Ba Odah Dismissal of Habeas Petition March 2014Case TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersApril 19, 2016Court issues minute order dismissing his habeas case as mootApril 19, 2016Court issues minute order dismissing his habeas case as mootAfter nearly ten months without ruling on Ba Odah's motion for judgment, the court issues minute order dismissing his habeas case as moot in light of his transfer.April 16, 2016Tariq Ba Odah released to Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaApril 16, 2016Tariq Ba Odah released to Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaAfter nine years on hunger strike and more than five years being cleared for transfer, Mr. Ba Odah is released to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Press ReleaseHunger Striker Whose Weight Dropped to 74 lbs Released From Guantánamo to Saudi ArabiaRelated ResourcesPress Release (Arabic Translation)September 11, 2015CCR files a reply in support of Ba Odah's motion for releaseSeptember 11, 2015CCR files a reply in support of Ba Odah's motion for releaseThree medical experts file supplemental declarations in further support of Ba Odah's motion for release.Press ReleaseAttorneys for 74-Pound Cleared Guantánamo Hunger Striker Tariq Ba Odah Urge Court to Order Release Over DOJ ObjectionsRelated FilesReply to Goverment Opposition to Motion for ReleaseExhibit 1: Farah DeclarationExhibit 2: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Jess GhannamExhibit 3: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Rami BailonyExhibit 4: Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Sondra CrosbyAugust 14, 2015Government opposes Ba Odah’s motion for judgmentAugust 14, 2015Government opposes Ba Odah’s motion for judgmentAfter requesting three extensions to file its response, the government opposes Ba Odah’s motion requesting that the court grants his habeas petition.
