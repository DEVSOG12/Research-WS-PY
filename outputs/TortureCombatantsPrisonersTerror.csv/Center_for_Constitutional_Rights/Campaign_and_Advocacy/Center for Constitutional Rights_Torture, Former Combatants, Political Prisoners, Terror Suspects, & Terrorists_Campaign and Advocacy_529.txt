On June 2, 2015, Reuters published unclassified information detailing the CIA’s torture of Khan.  In June 2016, in response to a FOIA lawsuit, the government made public a declassified version of Khan’s 2007 CSRT transcript, which contains more information about his time in custody. In October 2021, he delivered a personal statement at his sentencing hearing that lasted for more than two hours.Attachments  Majid Khan's Summary of His Torture .pdfLearn moreKhan v. Obama / Khan v.
