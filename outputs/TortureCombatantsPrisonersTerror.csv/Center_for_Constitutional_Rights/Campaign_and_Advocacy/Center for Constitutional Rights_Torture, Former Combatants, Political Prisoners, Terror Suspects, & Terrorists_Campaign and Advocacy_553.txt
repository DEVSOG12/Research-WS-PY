Briefing before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has been set for April and May.We have fought to keep this case alive over the last 11 years of litigation. Our clients deserve justice and redress: they deserve to have their stories heard and to see CACI held accountable for its role in torture and other human rights violations at Abu Ghraib. Justice requires truth and accountability under law. We will continue to fight. Stay tuned. #JusticeforAbuGhraib Case backgroundThis case is part of the Center for Constitutional Rights' effort to bring accountability for torture and other serious violations of international law arising out of the so-called “war on terror” and invasion of Iraq. Al Shimari v. CACI is a federal lawsuit brought by CCR in 2008 on behalf of Suhail Al Shimari, Asa’ad Zuba’e, and Salah Al-Ejaili, three Iraqi torture victims against U.S.-based government contractor CACI Premier Technology, Inc. The lawsuit asserts that CACI directed and participated in illegal conduct, including torture, at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq where it was hired by the U.S. to provide interrogation services. Plaintiffs were all held at the “hard site” in Abu Ghraib prison in 2003-2004. U.S. military investigators long ago concluded that CACI interrogators conspired with U.S. soldiers, who were later court martialed, to “soften up” detainees for interrogations. A U.S. Army general referred to the treatment as “sadistic, blatant, and wanton.” A number of low-level military officers were court-martialed over their roles in the abuse, but CACI has gone unpunished and continues to reap millions of dollars in government contracts.  Learn more about the caseProfile of Plaintiff Salah Hassan Al-EjailiDemocracy Now!
