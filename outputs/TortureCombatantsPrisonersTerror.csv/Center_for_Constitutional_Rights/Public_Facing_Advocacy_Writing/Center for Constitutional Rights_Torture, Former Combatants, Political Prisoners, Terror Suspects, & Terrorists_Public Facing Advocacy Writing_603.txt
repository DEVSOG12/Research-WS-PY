CCR senior staff attorney Wells Dixon issued the following statement:“We are relieved that Djamel has been released from secret detention in Algeria but remain deeply concerned. Djamel is very ill, and it is the responsibility of the Obama administration and the U.S. State Department to ensure his well-being.”For information on Djamel Ameziane’s case, visit CCR’s case page.CCR has led the legal battle over Guantánamo for nearly 12 years – representing clients in two Supreme Court cases and organizing and coordinating hundreds of pro bono lawyers across the country to represent the men at Guantanamo, ensuring that nearly all have the option of legal representation. Among other Guantánamo cases, the Center represents the families of men who died at Guantánamo, and men who have been released and are seeking justice in international courts.The Center for Constitutional Rights works with communities under threat to fight for justice and liberation through litigation, advocacy, and strategic communications. Since 1966, the Center for Constitutional Rights has taken on oppressive systems of power, including structural racism, gender oppression, economic inequity, and governmental overreach.
