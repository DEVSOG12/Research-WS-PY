First habeas corpus hearings 
on the horizon for men at 
Guantánamo 
 
The men at Guantánamo continue to 
await fair hearings before a real 
judge, following the Supreme Court 
decision in June 2008 – the Boume-
diene decision – that recognized 
their constitutional right to habeas 
corpus hearings. Attorneys for the 
Guantánamo detainees, and for the 
government, have filed a series of 
procedural briefs before various 
judges, including the lead judge in 
Washington, DC, coordinating many 
of these cases. The issues to be de-
cided include how much information 
each side can demand from the 
other; the basis for seeking court 
hearings on the evidence; the basis 
for allowing out-of-court statements, 
including hearsay, as evidence; the 
right to compel witnesses to appear; 
and the amount of proof necessary 
to justify detention, and who bears 
the burden of proof. The detainees’ 
attorneys are seeking a full process 
for the men at Guantánamo, while 
the government is seeking to create 
narrow hearings that provide very 
little due process. For most of the 
cases, the judge required the gov-
ernment to notify the attorneys for the 
men detained before they are trans-
ferred.  This was requested by the 
attorneys for the detainees so that 
they would know if the government 
intended to transfer them to countries 
where their lives or safety would be 
at risk.  The government is currently 
challenging the order.  The first court 
hearings are expected to take place 
in late September. Salim Ahmad Hamdan sen-
tenced to 5 ½ years, to be 
completed in six months, at 
close of first military commis-
sion 
 
In the first verdict to be issued by the 
U.S. military commissions at 
Guantánamo, Salim Ahmad Ham-
dan was convicted of material sup-
port for terrorism, and acquitted of 
conspiracy charges on August 5, 
2008. He was sentenced to 66 
months in prison, but the time that he 
has already been detained counts 
as part of that sentence, meaning his 
sentence will expire in six months. 
Hamdan was found guilty based 
largely upon his role as a paid driver 
of Osama bin Laden. He was found 
not guilty of three other counts of 
material support, and of two counts 
of conspiracy. The Bush Administra-
tion has not said that the government 
is required to release Hamdan, or 
any other military commission defen-
dant, at the end of his sentence, but 
has insisted that the government 
could continue to keep him.  
 
Hamdan had previously successfully 
challenged the military commissions 
system, in which the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled that the then-existing sys-
tem was invalid and that detainees 
at Guantánamo had rights under the 
Geneva Conventions. The Military 
Commissions Act, passed in 2006 
by Congress, created a new military 
commissions procedure. The new 
procedures, which deny defendants 
many rights recognized in U.S. crimi-
nal courts, continue to be challenged 
by advocates for the men at Guantánamo. 
 
In other military commissions news, 
on August 14, members of the de-
fense team for Mohammad Jawad, 
a young man at Guantánamo cur-
rently facing a military commission, 
submitted evidence that a military 
psychologist was complicit in 
Jawad’s abusive treatment at Guan-
tanamo.  The psychologist assessed 
Jawad’s mental condition after he 
was seen talking to a poster on his 
wall, and then authorized for him to 
be kept in isolation, despite what 
may have been evidence of mental 
stress or illness. Jawad, who was 
under 18 when he was captured in 
Afghanistan and a teenager when 
subjected to these tactics, later at-
tempted suicide. The military psy-
chologist has refused to testify about 
her experiences based on a protec-
tion against incriminating herself. In 
addition, on August 15, Ali Al-Bahlul 
announced that he refused to partici-
pate in the commissions process and 
would boycott the commission 
charging him.  
 
Guantánamo detainee 
Djamel Ameziane files com-
plaint before Inter-American 
Commission on Human 
Rights 
 
On August 6, 2008, Djamel 
Ameziane, an Algerian man held by 
the U.S. military at Guantánamo 
Bay, filed a petition with the Inter-
American Commission on Human 
Rights (IACHR), asking IACHR to 
consider the torture, abuse, and 
other human rights violations perpe-

Center for Constitutional Rights         www.ccrjus tice.org  (continued on  pg. 2) trated against him during his six 
years at Guantánamo. The IACHR 
receives and investigates reports 
of violations of the American Dec-
laration of the Rights and Duties of 
Man, to which the United States is 
a party.  Ameziane’s petition is the 
first such complaint to be filed to 
the IACHR by a detainee at the 
base. The IACHR has already is-
sued preliminary protective meas-
ures (precautionary measures) to 
prevent the US from committing 
further abuses against Ameziane, 
to consider his release in a timely 
manner, and to ensure that he is 
not returned to a country where he 
could face abuse once he is re-
leased. The US does not recog-
nize such precautionary measures 
from the IACHR as binding, how-
ever. 
 
Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, sus-
pected victim of enforced 
disappearance, appears in 
Manhattan court in U.S. 
custody 
 
On August 4, 2008, the U.S. Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation an-
nounced that longtime disap-
peared person and suspected 
“ghost detainee” Dr. Aafia Sid-
diqui was indeed in U.S. custody. 
Dr. Siddiqui is currently being held 
in New York City, and appeared 
in court on August 11, 2008. 
 
Dr. Siddiqui mysteriously disap-
peared, with her three children, 
from Karachi, Pakistan five years 
ago and has been suspected to 
have been held in secret U.S. 
“ghost detention” or by Pakistani 
intelligence. The location of only 
one of her children is currently 
known. The FBI nevertheless al-leged that she was arrested in 
Afghanistan on July 17 with reci-
pes for explosives and weaponry, 
and has not said anything about 
her being detained by the CIA. 
Dr. Siddiqui is accused of grab-
bing a soldier’s gun while he was 
attempting to arrest her and firing 
two shots.  She, herself, was shot 
and is deeply ill. Dr. Siddiqui is 
rumored to be the “Grey Lady of 
Bagram,” a female prisoner that 
former detainees reported hearing 
at the U.S. prison at Bagram in 
Afghanistan. 
 
Psychologists against tor-
ture challenge psychologi-
cal role in interrogations 
and detention 
 
On August 16, 2008, members of 
the American Psychological Asso-
ciation rallied outside the organi-
zation’s annual convention, calling 
upon the APA to take a stand 
against psychologists’ participa-
tion in interrogations and torture at 
Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere.  
 
Many members of the association 
have called for the APA to create 
a formal policy against the involve-
ment of its members in coercive 
interrogations. While the APA’s 
resolutions have become increas-
ingly critical of interrogation proce-
dures and members are prohibited 
from involvement with waterboard-
ing or physical abuse, the APA 
continues to support officially the 
involvement of its members in mili-
tary interrogations.  
 
On August 14, a state resolution 
passed the California legislature 
officially condemning torture and 
coercive interrogation and direct-
ing licensing boards to remind medical professionals of their ethi-
cal and legal obligations regard-
ing participation in torture and 
requesting that the Department of 
Defense and CIA remove Califor-
nia-based psychologists from such 
programs.
