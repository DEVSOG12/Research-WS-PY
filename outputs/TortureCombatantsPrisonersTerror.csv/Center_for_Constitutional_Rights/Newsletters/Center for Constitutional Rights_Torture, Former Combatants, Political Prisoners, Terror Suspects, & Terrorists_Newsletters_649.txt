President Obama issues 
Executive Order to close 
Guantanamo and CIA 
prisons within one year 
 
On January 22, 2008, newly inau-
gurated President Obama issued a 
series of executive orders. These ex-
ecutive orders required the closure 
of the prison camp at Guantanamo 
Bay within one year, ordered the 
closure of the secret CIA prisons or 
black sites, and ordered that all inter-
rogations comply with the Army Field 
Manual. 
 
The executive orders did not provide 
detailed structures or timelines for the 
dismantlement of the Guantanamo 
prison camp. The habeas litigation of 
Guantanamo detainees in the fed-
eral courts is continuing. The execu-
tive order also pledged a new re-
view of all current detainees’ files, as 
well as diplomatic efforts to release 
or transfer detainees. A separate 
executive order also temporarily sus-
pended all military commissions and 
all referrals to military commissions 
for the length of this review. 
 
The Center for Constitutional Rights 
praised the orders, but advised that it 
is neither necessary nor acceptable 
to continue indefinite detention with-
out charge for one more year before 
the eventual closure of Guantanamo.  
CCR reiterated that there are three 
steps that will allow Guantanamo to 
be closed easily and safely: repatri-
ating all the men who can go home; 
finding a safe third country for those 
who cannot return home for fear of 
torture or persecution; and charging those who will be charged with 
crimes in a standard U.S. federal 
criminal court. Furthermore, CCR has 
called on the Obama administration 
to end extended solitary confinement 
and other cruel and inhuman condi-
tions in Guantánamo immediately. 
 
Military Commissions  
Authority Admits 
Mohammad al Qahtani 
Tortured 
 
Susan Crawford, convening authority 
of the military commissions at Guan-
tanamo, said in an interview on Janu-
ary 14, 2009 that Guantánamo pris-
oner Mohammed al Qahtani was 
tortured during his US interrogations. 
Crawford referred to the well-
documented interrogations of al 
Qahtani that included sustained iso-
lation, sleep deprivation, forced nu-
dity, exposure to cold, and sexual 
abuse. Al Qahtani has been hospi-
talized on several occasions and his 
lawyers have repeatedly spoken 
about the damage caused him by 
his torture at Guantanamo. 
 
Crawford confirmed in the interview 
that she earlier had refused to refer 
military commissions charges against 
al Qahtani due to his torture. Al 
Qahtani’s attorneys at CCR have 
called for him to be repatriated to 
Saudi Arabia, and particularly, to the 
Saudi government’s intensive reha-
bilitation program for former detain-
ees. 
 
 
 European Countries Indi- 
cate Willingness to Ac- 
cept Guantanamo De- 
tainees in Need of Pro- 
tection 
 
France joined Portugal, Germany, 
Finland, Switzerland, Ireland and 
Sweden on January 14, 2009, as 
countries that have officially an-
nounced that they would consider 
granting humanitarian protection to 
former Guantanamo detainees as 
part of closing the prison camp or 
urging the European Union to ad-
dress this issue.  
 
Approximately 60 of the detainees 
currently held in Guantánamo can-
not lawfully be sent back to their 
countries of origin because they face 
a risk of persecution or torture. They 
come from countries including Alge-
ria, China, Libya, Russia, Syria, Tajiki-
stan, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan.  Oth-
ers are stateless and have no coun-
try to which they can return. 
 
Thus far, only Albania has accepted 
refugees from Guantánamo, accept-
ing eight men in 2006. In October 
2008, a federal judge ordered that 
the seventeen Uighurs, men of a 
Muslim ethnic minority from China, 
be released into the United States. 
The U.S. has resisted this judge’s 
order and has also claimed that it 
cannot find other safe third countries 
to accept the Guantánamo detain-
ees at risk for persecution.

tanamo Detainees File 
Suit Over Prisoner 
Deaths 
 
The parents of two detainees who 
died at Guantanamo, Yasser al-
Zahrani and Salah Ali Abdullah 
Ahmed al-Salami, filed a lawsuit 
against former Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld and 23 other 
military officers and personnel on 
January 7, 2009 for their role in 
the illegal detention, torture, inhu-
mane conditions, and ultimate 
deaths of their sons at 
Guantánamo. 
 
Al-Zahrani of Saudi Arabia, who 
was just 17 at the time of his ar-
rest, and Al-Salami of Yemen were 
reportedly found dead in their 
cells at Guantanamo on June 10, 
2006.  At the time of their deaths, 
both men had been detained in-
communicado for more than four 
years without charge in conditions 
constituting torture. 
 
The families of the men also seek 
to hold the U.S. government re-
sponsible for its callous response 
following the deaths.  Government 
officials never notified the men’s 
families that their sons had died. 
 
While Islamic law calls for burials 
within 24 hours of death, the re-
mains of the men were not re-
turned to their home countries until 
almost a week after they died, 
and with organs removed and 
signs of physical injury and 
trauma.  Autopsies were per-
formed on the men without notify-
ing their families or obtaining the 
families’ consent.  Government 
officials also made a number of derisive comments about the men 
following their deaths, including 
referring to the deaths as “a good 
PR move to get attention.” 
 
Hunger Strikes Con- 
tinue at Guantanamo 
 
Lawyers have reported that over 
70 men are currently engaged in 
a hunger strike at Guantanamo. 
The men are very frustrated over 
their continued detention without 
charge, as well as by the condi-
tions of confinement.  In Camps 5 
and 6, men are subject to exten-
sive solitary confinement. Hunger 
striking detainees are often force-
fed by the military, using equip-
ment and measures that have 
been widely condemned as abu-
sive and inhumane. 
 
Six detainees, includ- 
ing Haji Bismullah, 
transferred from Guan- 
tanamo 
 
On January 17, 2009, six detain-
ees were transferred from Guan-
tanamo—four to Iraq, one to Alge-
ria and one to Afghanistan. 
 
Mohammed al-Gharani 
wins habeas case; or- 
dered released 
 
On January 13, 2009, Moham-
med al-Gharani, a young 
Chadian man held at Guan-
tanamo, was ordered released in 
his habeas corpus hearing by a 
federal judge. Al-Gharani, who 
was approximately 14 years old 
when he was taken to Guan-
tanamo after being seized in Paki-
stan by Pakistani intelligence forces, has been held without 
charge at the prison camp since 
2002. Of the 27 men whose 
cases have been heard by federal 
judges in the United States, 24 
have been ordered released.
