It concludes that the CIA repeatedly tortured detainees, including using the simulated drowning technique called “waterboarding.” The report also concludes that the information gathered using torture produced no security benefits and accuses the CIA of repeatedly lying to Congress, the White House and the American public.SEE: Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation ProgramIn a statement, CAIR said:“This disturbing report clearly demonstrates the need for those who approved of and carried out this campaign of torture to be held accountable for their actions. It also shows that strong legal and policy measures need to be enacted in order to prevent such illegal actions being taken during any future security crisis.”“Torture is not an American value. We should not be questioning whether or not it worked, but why we ever used such brutal and illegal interrogation techniques.”The Washington-based civil rights organization plans to review the summary report and urges the Senate Intelligence Committee to release the full report to ensure full disclosure and transparency of America's counterterrorism and torture programs.CAIR is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. Its mission is to enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding.– END –CONTACT: CAIR Government Affairs Manager Robert McCaw, 202-742-6448, rmccaw@cair.com; CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper, 202-744-7726, ihooper@cair.com; CAIR Communications Manager Amina Rubin, 202-488-8787, 202-341-4171, arubin@cair.comÂFacebookTwitterLatest Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Resignation of North Carolina Sheriff Over Racist CommentsOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and JudgesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Director Jaylani Hussein Responds to Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-LA Condemns Antisemitic Statements Made by Kanye West and the Disgusting Show of Support From Neo-Nazis in Los AngelesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesMaryland Community to Call on Montgomery County Council to Reject Disputed IHRA Definition of Antisemitism and Anti-Palestinian RacismOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Calls EU Court Ruling Allowing Hijab Bans in the Workplace a Setback for Religious FreedomOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesContact info453 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20003Tel: (202) 488-8787Fax: (202) 488-0833www.cair.comMore contact infoAbout UsVision, Mission, Core PrinciplesCAIR at a GlanceCAIR: Who We AreNational Board of DirectorsDepartment DirectorsAnnual Reports and FinancialsEndorsements, Awards, RecognitionsCAIR ChaptersDispelling Rumors About CAIRWorking with Law EnforcementNews & MediaMedia ContactsPress ReleasesOp-edsBookable SpeakersVideosMedia ResearchCAIR LogosPhotosGet involvedCareersInternVolunteerEventsBecome an AllyUse Your VoiceResourcesKnow Your RightsCivil Rights ReportsWays to GiveGuides and toolkitsGuides to Muslim Religious PracticesBook a CAIR WorkshopRequest a SpeakerRegister to VoteGovernment Affairs ReportsTake ActionReport an incidentAction AlertsScroll to TopPrivacy PolicyLegalVolunteerJoin our Email ListEventsContact UsFacebook-fTwitterInstagramYoutube© 2022 Council on American-Islamic Relations.Website designed by INTELLIPLANS
