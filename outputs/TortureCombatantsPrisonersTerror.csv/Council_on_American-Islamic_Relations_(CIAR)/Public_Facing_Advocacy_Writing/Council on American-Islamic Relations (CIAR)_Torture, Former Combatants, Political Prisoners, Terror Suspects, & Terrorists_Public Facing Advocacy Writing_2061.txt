Civil Liberties Protection in the Patriot Act ReauthorizationThe House will most likely take up the Patriot Act conference report on Wednesday, December 14. A vote to prevent Sen. Russ Fiengold’s threatened filibuster in the Senate will probably occur Friday. A filibuster, essentially an extended debate, would prevent any vote on the Patriot Act, since Senate rules provide that a vote can only occur once a debate is completed. Senate leadership needs 60 votes to prevent a filibuster. SEE ALSO: CAIR’s Patriot Act Bloghttp://cairpatriotact.blogspot.com/2. Anti-Torture MeasuresSen. John McCain’s measure prohibiting the use of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” against anyone in U.S. government custody anywhere in the world has strong Senate support. The administration, using Vice-President Cheney as point, is lobbying against the measure. President Bush has threatened to use his first-ever veto to protect torture.3. Immigration ReformSecure borders and enforcement of immigration law are important. However, legislation currently before the House is ill-considered. Among other concerns, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act (H.R. 4437) empowers low-level law enforcement officers to deport, without a hearing, anyone within 100 miles of the border that the agent thinks is undocumented.IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUESTED:1. Follow the link provided below and make the calls to your elected officials. (We are requesting phone calls because e-mails and faxes may not be read until after this week.) It is easy and effective.You will be asked only for your ZIP code (to prove that you are a constituent) and where you stand on an issue. You need not be an expert, only concerned.TO CONTACT YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, GO TO: http://capwiz.com/cair/callalert/index.tt?alertid=8313031&type=COSAMPLE PHONE CALL SCRIPT:“As your constituent, I am asking your office to do the following things:“1) HOUSE: Oppose final Patriot Act reauthorization until it includes more civil liberties protections like those contained in the Senate version of the bill. SENATE: Support Senator Feingold’s efforts to enhance the civil liberties protections in the Patriot Act. Please vote against cloture.“2) HOUSE AND SENATE: Support sending Senator John McCain’s anti-torture language to the President without any modifications.“3) HOUSE: Vote against HR. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act. The bill is not a comprehensive solution. Comprehensive immigration reform can be dealt with in 2006. [This bill is not before the Senate.]”2. Put your cell phone to good use.Call all of your friends and family members and ensure that they contact their elected officials. Act as a facilitator. You can enter their ZIP code into our website at http://capwiz.com/cair/dbq/officials/ and get the names and contact information of their representatives (1 Member of the U.S. House and 2 Members of the U.S. Senate).3) Push your community leaders to action.Give your local Imam or community a copy of this alert and ask him/her to use it as talking points for a Friday sermon.
