In 1999, this groundbreaking resource was adopted as the United Nations’ recognized standard. With it, PHR and our partners have trained thousands of health professionals on five continents to evaluate and document forensic medical evidence of torture. This global network of experts is providing critical material medical evidence that is helping to break down the wall of impunity for perpetrators of torture.The Istanbul Protocol Model CurriculumTogether with the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and other NGOs, PHR has developed model training materials for health professionals to document torture and ill-treatment according to Istanbul Protocol standards.The Istanbul Protocol Strengthening ProjectPHR is currently leading a multi-year international effort to update and strengthen Istanbul Protocol norms in partnership with the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, REDRESS, the UN Committee against Torture, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, and the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. The project includes the participation of more than 180 experts from 51 countries and seeks to strengthen the Istanbul Protocol through updates and clarifications, including guidelines for states to implement the conditions necessary for effective torture investigation and documentation.Our WorkPress ReleasePHR Medical Director Elected to The National Academy of MedicinePress ReleaseIran’s Government Must End Brutal Crackdown on Protesters, Respect International Human Rights Law: PHRBlogAdvocating Against Attacks on Health at the United Nations: Reflections on the 51st Session of the Human Rights CouncilBlogDoctors Who Knowingly Spread COVID-19 Lies Should be Held AccountablePress ReleaseГромадські організації закликають комісію ООН розслідувати обстріли українських лікарень РосієюPress ReleaseNGOs Call on New UN Commission to Investigate Russia’s Bombardment of Ukrainian HospitalsDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
