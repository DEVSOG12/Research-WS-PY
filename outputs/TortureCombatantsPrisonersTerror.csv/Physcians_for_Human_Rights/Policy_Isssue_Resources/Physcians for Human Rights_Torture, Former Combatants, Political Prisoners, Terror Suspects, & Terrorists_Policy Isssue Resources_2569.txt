Torture breaks people’s bodies and minds, rips apart communities, and destroys democratic institutions and the rule of law. Since our founding in 1986, PHR’s core mission has included investigating, documenting, and reporting the devastating consequences of torture on individuals, institutions, and society.Torture and ill-treatment often have serious health consequences for their victims. Sometimes they leave physical scars; often they result in profound and long-term psychological trauma. Health professionals can detect signs of physical and mental abuse that are not evident to traditional investigators. As such, they can play a critical role in preventing torture and ensuring accountability.Across the globe, PHR’s work provides physical and psychological proof of torture and ill-treatment. We validate survivors’ voices, investigate abusive detention and other practices, and expose medical professionals who enable or participate in torture. We empower communities around the world to document evidence, so that torturers can be brought to justice and these abusive practices can end.This is how we work:Investigation and DocumentationWe use forensic medicine and scientific investigation to document the health effects of torture.Setting Anti-Torture NormsWe use our global leadership to set norms that challenge impunity for torture.Building Capacity to Prevent TortureWe are empowering a global network of health professionals with the tools to prevent torture and ensure that perpetrators face justice.Evidence-based AdvocacyWe draw on our decades of expertise to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that will end torture and ill-treatment.Our WorkPress ReleasePHR Medical Director Elected to The National Academy of MedicinePress ReleaseIran’s Government Must End Brutal Crackdown on Protesters, Respect International Human Rights Law: PHRBlogAdvocating Against Attacks on Health at the United Nations: Reflections on the 51st Session of the Human Rights CouncilBlogDoctors Who Knowingly Spread COVID-19 Lies Should be Held AccountablePress ReleaseГромадські організації закликають комісію ООН розслідувати обстріли українських лікарень РосієюPress ReleaseNGOs Call on New UN Commission to Investigate Russia’s Bombardment of Ukrainian HospitalsView AllDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
