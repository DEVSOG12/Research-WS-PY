Méndez, former UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The discussion was moderated by Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU and PHR board member, in October 2019.In it, these leading global anti-torture advocates discuss progress made by the international movement to end torture, the challenge of shifting cultural ideas around torture, and why the film “The Report” is a timely reminder of the ongoing impunity for the torture utilized by the U.S. military after the attacks of September 11, 2001.Anthony Romero: I want to reflect first on the U.S. context. Talk to me first about how big of a mistake is it in your point of view that we do not hold anyone accountable for torture.Dr. Vince Iacopino: This is the United States of America: we prohibited torture and we criticized other countries [for practicing it]. All of a sudden, we acknowledge that [U.S.] torture has been systematic and authorized by policy and no one is held into account? There’s been no accountability. There’s been a great amount of information that we’ve been able to glean, but there are millions of pages more. The new Hollywood movie called “The Report” speaks to the millions of pages that didn’t end up into the [torture] report. We are upside-down and backwards right now because we don’t have the truth.The narrative still stands: we didour best to try to obtain information and we tortured thousands of people. Noone has been charged there except for a few people. This is horrendous. But wewill repeat this history of violence in this country if we don’t acknowledgethe truth.Juan E. Méndez: The United States is at fault, under internationalIaw. The bad example has spread and continues to spread. We need to investigateand punish every act of torture. Some are saying, well, maybe under thecircumstances, people who tortured thought that they were doing somethinglawful. For me, saying that is an insult to our intelligence. They didn’t havethe authority by law, so the actions are not legal.Romero: Why is that, given the current state of the West Wing, why don’t we see or hear more about individuals being rendered or greater use of torture. Do you think it’s still such a norm?Méndez: I can only speculate… Most of the war against terror has shifted. Now it’s more territorial. They don’t apprehend people, they kill them in battle.Early on, the George W. Bushadministration seemed to be intent on gathering a lot of people, torturingthem, and keeping them for whatever length of time to destroy al-Qaeda andISIS. I think now the war has shifted. They don’t rely so much on either thecooperation of other states or their own kidnapping forces around the world.They don’t rely on them for interrogation. That speculation of course canchange. If we have another attack here on the United States, I think it will bea lot worse the next time around.“The United States is at fault, under international Iaw. The bad example has spread and continues to spread. We need to investigate and punish every act of torture.”Juan E. MéndezRomero: There are activities [of] this administration that we find problematic, such as conditions of confinement of immigrants in detention centers, overcrowding detention centers. We have big debates on whether or not to call this torture.Iacopino: It’s obviously cruel and inhumane. It is the inflictionof severe physical and mental pain. The severity and the vulnerability: that istorture. We know it’s hard to prove it… [but], in my perspective, it’storture.Romero: Give us abetter sense of the progress we’re making, the case to prevent torture. Talk tome a little bit about where you see the debate, what we need to do differentlyto regroup, to ground our understanding of torture as an effective or ineffectivetool in interrogation.Méndez: We have been losing a lot of ground in the battle againsttorture. It’s false to say that torture works. It’s false to say that it’sinevitable or useful at all. It’s false to say that sometimes it is the onlything that gets us safe and secure, and so I have some sense that we can stillregain the universal condemnation [that we saw] from before 2001.But I think the main obstacle wehave for abolishing torture in our time is this kind of cultural acknowledgementand acceptance of torture. Pop culture conditions us into thinking that tortureis something that is inevitable, that when it comes to very serious crimes liketerrorism, organized crime, that it’s the only thing that works. I think wereally need to regain the upper hand in the popular culture. I think someimportant things are being done along those lines, but I think that we have todo a lot more.Iacopino: As Juan already said, torture is not a rational act thatproduces information. There’s a lot of neurobiology to support this: when youinflict severe pain on an individual, it has cognitive effects. It’s unethicaland causes severe pain and suffering.With the Senate Select Committee onIntelligence Report, there were 6,700 pages that never saw the light of day.There were about 500 pages, heavily redacted, of the executive summary. Itshowed that questionable intelligence was gained that could otherwise [havebeen] gained by non-coercive methods. This is a huge applied research study, ifyou will, that we practiced torture in theaters of operation, torturedthousands of people, and got no actionable intelligence.Does torture work? Look at ourhistory, we knew before we started this policy of widespread, systematictorture in the U.S.-Vietnam terror. We knew ahead of time that it didn’t work…TheCIA acknowledged in the 1970’s and 1980’s that it produces false confessions.Romero: Juan, you have worked on the torture issue at the highest levels of the human rights community, as a Special Rapporteur, at Human Rights Watch, and other experience, but what makes you so different from those of us who work on torture is that you have first-hand experience. Help us understand a little about the years and the time you spent as a victim and now a survivor of torture. How does that change the way you think about the work and inform the way you approach your work at the highest policy levels in the world?Méndez: Yes, I suffered torture under the government of Argentina alittle before the military coup. I was very interested in the matter of tortureand particularly on how to confront it because I was a young lawyer; Irepresented political prisoners, and almost all the work we did was to stoppeople from being tortured by petition for habeas corpus or by makingdenunciations in public.I got very lucky because I was arrested and tortured at a time when they still did not have the disappearance policy in place. So, yes, they tortured me very brutally. I then spent a year and a half in prison before being adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience.I came into exile and I met somewonderful people here in the United States, including people who were startingto document torture from a scientific and medical perspective. That’s how Ibecame acquainted with many of you, and what eventually became Physicians forHuman Rights. I have long admired your organization. I always thought that whatwe needed to do is to make sure that every act of torture is investigated,prosecuted, and punished. If we could only make sure that the torturer knowsthat he or she will see the inside of a jail, then maybe we could prevent it.Over the years, however, I learned that investigating, prosecuting, andpunishing is not that easy. We need to, most of all, force the political will.But one way of forcing the political will is being very good about documentingtorture and making sure that we put institutions on the spot so they cannotdeny that torture has happened.As the special rapporteur ontorture, I always visited countries with the assistance of a physician who wasa forensic expert. I became very familiar with the Istanbul Protocol, and howuseful it can be if we know how to use it. Prevention has many facets, but Istill think that investigating, prosecuting, and punishing is central to thetask of abolishing torture in our lifetime.“Prevention has many facets, but I still think that investigating, prosecuting, and punishing is central to the task of abolishing torture in our lifetime.”Juan E. MéndezRomero: Vince, let meask you to give a broader context around the Istanbul Protocol… Can you giveus a sense of what it is, and how effective has it been in the development of theanti-torture movement?Iacopino: With regards to the Istanbul Protocol, it simply happened because Turkish doctors were not empowered to submit their own testimonies in courts of law… the State’s forensic doctors would dismiss the facts, neglect evidence, and simply write a sentence saying there’s no evidence at all. We decided in a meeting that we should come up with a framework that holds States accountable to their obligations to investigate and document torture. That was the very simple idea we had. We used our best knowledge. We were 75 people from 40 different organizations and from 15 countries. It took us three years to develop a series of guidelines and principles on the effective investigation and documentation of torture. Today, it’s impressive to me to see how it’s been used. We know that it’s been cited in regional courts and human rights mechanisms. It has really become the gold standard for effective investigation and documentation of torture.Romero: Juan you’vebeen working on a series of protocols for non-coercive interviewing methods.Can you talk about how you’re approaching that work, and how that can helpreignite the commitment that torture does indeed not work?Méndez: I drew inspiration for it from the work of the ACLU andothers on documenting torture early on and also from the great law enforcementpeople who stood up and said it’s immoral and illegal. Not only does it notwork; it’s very counter-productive.In my very last report as a Special Rapporteur in the UN General Assembly in October 2016, I suggested that we needed a [new] instrument, like the Istanbul Protocol for the Documentation of Torture, like the Nelson Mandela Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. We needed one on how to do effective criminal investigations and interviews that [are] free from torture, a process that is legal and ethical but is also much more effective.This is a complex task, as you canimagine, but I’m very excited. I think by next year we’ll have something toshow to the world. It’s going to be a form of universalizing a method that isproven, and that is based on the presumption of innocence in the beginning ofthe process; not on the search [for] confession, but [for] truth.Romero: Let’s wrap up with where you think we should go. Give us a sense of where you think we should go to make a difference.Iacopino: Think about the time in 2004 when the Abu Ghraib photoscame out. When people see it, they know it’s torture. They know this issomething we shouldn’t do. When you hear somebody scream, when you see theirinjuries, when they learn about their psychological pain, and how their liveshave been changed forever. I think people have to understand the consequencesof those actions and the truth about its utility, the counterproductivity, andhow it is jeopardizing human rights. Other organizations have done remarkablework getting retired admirals and generals to talk about how this jeopardizesthe soldiers who are in the field. I think people need an understanding of whattorture is. To stigmatize it as it should be – that in itself is prevention. Ruleof law, accountability, [and] justice are critically important. We need toprosecute people who are responsible, and that includes health professionalswho are complicit.On the other side of this, I’vetaught health and human rights for many years. I think there’s a culturalaspect to promoting human dignity and the idea of rights as essential to oursurvival, to our health as human beings. If you look at climate change andglobal inequality, we’re on a path to self-destruction. The only way to surviveis to be healthy and to respect one another for the equality and dignity thatwe all have.“When people see it, they know it’s torture. They know this is something we shouldn’t do. When you hear somebody scream, when you see their injuries, when they learn about their psychological pain, and how their lives have been changed forever.” Dr. Vince IacopinoMéndez: I think it’s important that we use the word torture whereit’s justified. We need to explain … why we’re fighting against this torture,beginning with the severity of pain and suffering, the intent factor, and thepurpose factor. Through that context, we can play a very good educational rolein making people understand. In terms of what we need to do, it’s to side withthose in the front trenches that are fighting against torture in very difficultcircumstances: medical professionals, lawyers, and the torture victimsthemselves. Help give them a voice, amplify what they say and defend, protectthem from retribution for the role they play in fighting torture.I think we also need to strengthenthe mechanism of accountability, domestically and internationally. I think weneed to strengthen the mechanism of protection, especially [at] the UnitedNations level. We need to persuade states to participate in much more effectiveways than what has been displayed lately.RelatedPapers and Reports on U.S. TortureTorture in U.S. National Security DetentionReportBroken Laws, Broken LivesDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
