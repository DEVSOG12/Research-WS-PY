Such an anniversary is an appropriate time to reflect on the commitment President Barack Obama made to closing the detention facility and press for greater progress toward this ultimate goal.In recent months we have seen some progress toward closing Guantánamo, as individual detainees have been transferred out of the facility, but serious obstacles remain. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the use of funds to transfer detainees to the United States for any purpose – even to obtain medical care. Policies at the facility continue to allow for the force-feeding of hunger strikers, despite clear professional ethics that forbid such acts by medical professionals. Perhaps most disturbingly, twelve years after the opening of the detention facility for “war on terror” detainees, not a single public official has been held accountable for abusive interrogation techniques used at Guantánamo.As Physicians for Human Rights looks forward, we will continue pressing for the release of information concerning torture and other abuses on the part of U.S. officials, accountability for any crimes, a revision of policies so that they comply with internationally-recognized medical ethics, and ultimately the end of indefinite detention and the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention center.This is the current state of Guantánamo:5: Years since President Obama signed an executive order to close the Guantánamo detention center and curb abuse in interrogation155: Detainees who remain in Guantánamo Bay detention facility as of January 11, 2014166: Detainees in Guantánamo Bay detention facility one year ago77: Detainees in Guantánamo that have been cleared for release by the United States government but still remain in the facility17: Years it will take to bring the population of detainees in Guantánamo down to zero, if the current rate of transfer continues106: Guantánamo detainees who were on hunger strike in summer 201345: Detainees who underwent force-feeding in summer 20130: Differences between the ethical obligations of medical professionals caring for detainees in Guantánamo and medical professionals caring for patients in non-detention settings0: Situations in which the World Medical Association finds force-feeding of hunger strikers to be justifiedUnknown: number of current hunger strikers (because the Obama Administration stopped releasing this number to the public)150: Number of doctors who signed a letter to allow independent medical care for Guantánamo detainees2: Special envoys whom President Obama appointed in 2013 to specifically address detainees in Guantánamo – Cliff Sloan was appointed as a Special Envoy in the State Department and Paul Lewis became a Special Envoy in the Department of Defense6,000: Approximate number of pages in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report that details CIA interrogation and detention practices; those familiar with the report’s contents have indicated that it reveals torture and other abusive practices committed by interrogators0: U.S. officials held accountable for crimes of torture against detainees in GuantánamoRelatedBlogDoctors Who Knowingly Spread COVID-19 Lies Should be Held AccountableWebinarNext Steps for the Global Anti-Torture Movement: Istanbul Protocol 2022Press ReleasePHR Welcomes BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Decision to End Use of “Excited Delirium” DiagnosisDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
