Reversing a decade-long policy of permitting psychologists to aid abusive CIA and military interrogators, the American Psychological Association (APA) finally banned psychologists from taking part in interrogations or working at detention sites operating in violation of international human rights law – sites like Guantánamo Bay detention center. In response, the Pentagon withdrew psychologists from all detainee operations at Guantánamo.The APA’s new policy was the result of years of pressure from PHR and our partners. But since 2015, the policy has come under repeated scrutiny and threat of reversal. We have continued our pressure on the APA to maintain its stand against unethical practices – and in August 2018, we were vindicated. At its annual meeting, the APA successfully upheld the ban.RelatedBlogDoctors Who Knowingly Spread COVID-19 Lies Should be Held AccountableWebinarNext Steps for the Global Anti-Torture Movement: Istanbul Protocol 2022Press ReleasePHR Welcomes BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Decision to End Use of “Excited Delirium” DiagnosisDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
