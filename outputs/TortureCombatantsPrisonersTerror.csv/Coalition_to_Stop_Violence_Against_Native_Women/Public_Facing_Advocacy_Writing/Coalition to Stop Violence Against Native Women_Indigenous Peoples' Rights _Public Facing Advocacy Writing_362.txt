Native women have a long history when it comes to not having fully informed consent during birth and this policy continues a reprehensible history of institutions making decisions on behalf of new mothers when it comes to their health.”While several Pueblos and the Navajo Nation in New Mexico have been hit hard by the coronavirus, recording some of the highest per capita rates of COVID-19 infection in the nation, it is important to note that not all tribes have high prevalence of COVID-19. “For Lovelace to screen pregnant women to see if they look Native American and comparing their home ZIP code against a list of tribal reservation ZIP codes, maintained by the hospital, indicates the assumption that all Native people in New Mexico have COIVD-19”, says Charley.“While CDC guidelines currently suggest the temporary separation of newborns from a mother suspected of being symptomatic of Covid-19”, says Indigenous Women Rising Co-Founder, Nicole Martin, “we are concerned that performing this separation without informed consent is a racial targeting practice that targets Native mothers based on their ZIP code.” Indigenous Women Rising is an organization committed to honoring Native and Indigenous Peoples’ inherent right to equitable and culturally safe health options through accessible education, resources and advocacy.The policies implemented by Lovelace have raised concerns about racial profiling and patient consent which have since prompted an investigation from New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.Filed Under: News ReleasesAs a tribal coalition, CSVANW does not provide emergency or directs services.If you are in an unsafe situation or need immediate assistance please dial 911.For a safe, confidential way to talk with someone right now, please call:Rape Abuse Incest National Network: 1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)www.rainn.orgNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE)www.ndvh.orgStrong Hearts Native Helpline: 1-844-762-8483www.strongheartshelpline.orgWho Are WeWe focus our work on communities and systems.
