Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture released the following statement today reiterating that despite claims to the contrary, the U.S. torture program has not been vindicated by the death of Osama Bin Laden:"The architects of the United States torture polices will stop at nothing in their attempt to defend the indefensible. Torture is always wrong and immoral. Torture has not been vindicated; it is a stain on America's promise and cost us the good will of many who could have helped us locate bin Laden years earlier."The world community recognizes that torture is always morally wrongand illegal; the United States has agreed.  Torture debases the personstortured, as well as the torturers, and it violates the basic tenets ofall major religions."The claims made by the proponents of the torture program prove thecompelling need for the establishment of a government-sponsoredCommission of Inquiry with full subpoena power to let the public knowthe full extent and consequences of the torture program.  Nothing ismore important for the soul of America at this time than an unrestrictedand comprehensive review of the U.S. torture program."###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
