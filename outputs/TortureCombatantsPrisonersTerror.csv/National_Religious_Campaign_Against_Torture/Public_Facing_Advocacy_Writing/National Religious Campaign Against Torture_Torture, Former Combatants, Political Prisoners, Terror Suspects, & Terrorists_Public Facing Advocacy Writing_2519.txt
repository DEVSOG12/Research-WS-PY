Guantanamo is an internationally recognized symbol of a time when our nation's leaders betrayed our values and tortured people, and a prison where most continue to be detained without charge or trial. President Obama promised to close the prison at Guantanamo almost seven years ago.Today, Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture called upon President Obama to live up to his promise, saying:"Torture and imprisonment without trial are immoral and contrary to American values. Last year, Congress and the President took action to permanently end torture by passing bi-partisan legislation that prevents the U.S. from ever again using torture to interrogate people. Unfortunately, when it comes to holding people in detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay, our political and military leaders have been absent without leave.The President should use his final State of the Union to make clear to Congress, and those in the Administration who have been obstacles to transferring detainees, that this is the year that he will close Guantanamo. The President has a good legacy on ending torture. He must match that with a legacy of ending indefinite detention without trial at Guantanamo."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
