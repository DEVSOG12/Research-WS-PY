Having passed the House last week, it is now expected to become law.Rev. Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released this statement praising Congress for this morally significant action:"The CIA torture program was a tragic mistake. Not only was it harmful to our security, but, more importantly, it cast doubt on our country's role as a moral leader in the world. Leaders from the many different American faith communities agree – torture is always wrong."By voting to pass the NDAA, a bipartisan majority of Congress voted to put a permanent end to CIA torture. The McCain-Feinstein provision requires that the CIA use only ethical, legal interrogation techniques and ensures that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to all detainees. This is consistent with American values and with the basic requirement to treat people humanely that is common to all faiths."Unfortunately, the NDAA also includes severe restrictions on transferring detainees out of Guantanamo. Most of the people in Guantanamo are being held without charge or trial – a situation that is morally wrong. We hope that Congress and the President will act to close the prison there as soon as possible."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.

Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
