Richard L. Killmer, the Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, issued the following statement:“The National Religious Campaign Against Torture is grateful that the Attorney General has begun to consider an investigation for criminal culpability of CIA agents who may have violated anti-torture laws. But it is not enough. NRCAT calls upon the Attorney General to undertake a comprehensive investigation of the authorization and use of torture by officials and agents of the United States Government to determine criminal culpability.The Inspector General’s report describes the horrific and illegal abuse of detainees in U.S. custody.  The report goes beyond what has previously been released to describe CIA agents threatening prisoners with death and carrying out a mock execution.  It also describes the use of waterboarding and other methods of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.An investigation for criminal culpability of all who have broken the law is an important step toward ending this sordid chapter of American history.  It is our responsibility to assure that future generations of Americans grow up in a country that does not torture.”///The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a growing membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 250 religious groups have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Roman Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Baha'i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.# # # END # # #HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
