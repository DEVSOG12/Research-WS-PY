Instead of showing brutal, months-long torture of suspects that yielded little actionable intelligence, the film softens and justifies the extensive use of torture by American officials in the pursuit of intelligence.The planners and enactors of torture have been trying to rewrite history in memoirs, hoping to paint themselves in a more favorable light, and Hollywood is giving them an assist with ‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty.‚ÄùThe torture scenes in ‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty‚Äù are unpleasant, but the producers kept them brief and situated them in dialogue that re-emphasizes the importance of the pursuit of intelligence. This portrayal gives viewers the sense that they are seeing a balanced and realistic perspective ‚Äî a clever but false technique. The reality is that no audience could sit through an accurate portrayal of what American interrogators did to those in their custody.People are also reading‚Ä¶Youngkin says Va. will not follow CDC recommendation on COVID shotsT.J.

The reality of torture is that it is a repetitive, mundane, brutal exercise that degrades both the captive and the torturers. It goes against the tenets of international law and every major religious and moral code, and nevertheless yields little information of actual value.‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty‚Äù not only soft-pedals the extent of torture used against detainees in American custody, but conveys a connection between interrogations and the locating of bin Laden that goes against known facts about the case.Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which spent more than three years investigating the torture program through access to classified information, have refuted the notion that interrogations led to bin Laden‚Äôs killing.That committee even wrote to Sony Pictures Studios to protest the film‚Äôs depictions. One former ex-officio member of the committee, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a May 2011 speech, ‚ÄúIt was not torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees that got us the major leads that ultimately enabled our intelligence community to find Osama bin Laden. ‚Ä¶ In fact ‚Ä¶ the use of ‚Äòenhanced interrogation techniques‚Äô on Khalid Sheik Mohammed ‚Ä¶ produced false and misleading information.‚ÄùIt may be true that the real-life officer portrayed as the hero in the film spearheaded the search for bin Laden, but the idea that key information came from torture is a fiction created by torturers and repeated by Hollywood.The authors of the torture program have been working for years to rewrite their actions. Ironically, the film highlights the borderline criminal activities pursued in these officials‚Äô attempts to justify their actions. In the film, the protagonist reviews hours of interrogation tapes, identifying key bits of information about bin Laden‚Äôs most trusted courier, whom she later uses to find bin Laden in Pakistan.A trove of just such interrogation tapes did exist, but CIA clandestine officer Jose Rodriguez destroyed them and then went on to write a passionate defense of the CIA‚Äôs use of enhanced interrogation, joining a chorus of other officials shouting against the wind.Before the real history of American torture is overwritten completely by fiction, we must demand to see the full report of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the scale, nature and effectiveness of enhanced interrogation. The committee has adopted the report, but it has not yet made it public. I join the more than 300 religious and faith groups of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture in saying: It must.‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty‚Äù is an entertaining film, but it is not the truth, and the country must not forget that after leaving the theater.Stephen B.
