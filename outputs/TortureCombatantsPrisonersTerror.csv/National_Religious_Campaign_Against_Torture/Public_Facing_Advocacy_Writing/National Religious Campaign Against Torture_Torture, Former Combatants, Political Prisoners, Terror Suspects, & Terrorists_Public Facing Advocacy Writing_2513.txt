Too often lines are drawn between people of different ethnicities, religions, and cultures, and some use those lines in an attempt to justify killing, torture, and other immoral acts of brutality. While we represent a diversity of faith traditions, we stand together in a shared belief in the God-given dignity of each person and the conviction that America should reject the forces that divide people and should protect those who are at risk of torture, rape, genocide, and other violations of human dignity. Our faith traditions teach us that standing up for the vulnerable and those in need is at integral to the well-being of our shared community.”The full text of the faith leader letter to President-elect Donald Trump can be found below:January 10, 2017President-elect Donald TrumpTrump Tower735 5th AvenueNew York, NY 10022cc: Members of the 115th CongressDear President-elect Trump,As representatives of many different faith communities, we are writing to convey our hope and prayers that you will robustly defend the dignity of all people and strive to advance democracy, human rights, and rule of law both here at home and around the world.We live in an era when fear and anger have eroded the common concern for human life and human dignity.
