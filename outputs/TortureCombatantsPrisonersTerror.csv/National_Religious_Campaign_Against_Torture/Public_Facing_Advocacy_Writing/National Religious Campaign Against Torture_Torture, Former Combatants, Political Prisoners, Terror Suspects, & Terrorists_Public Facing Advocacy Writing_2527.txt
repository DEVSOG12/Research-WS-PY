In July, before his historic visit to El Reno federal prison, President Obama made his most critical statements on solitary confinement to date and announced the Department of Justice will conduct a national review of the practice.The letter to the President comes on the heels of a study of the federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) use of solitary confinement, which detailed widespread abuse, the placement of persons with severe mental illness in solitary, and estimated that more than 10,000 individuals are held in conditions of isolation by BOP on any given day.Prolonged solitary confinement has been defined as torture by the United Nations and is widely opposed by human rights, criminal justice reform and religious organizations. The National Religious Campaign Against Torture has mobilized people of faith to oppose solitary confinement for many years. With momentum building over the past months, today over twenty national religious organizations – including the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), the Union for Reform Judaism, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States and Canada, and the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church – joined this call for the White House to ensure the nationwide review outlines a clear path toward ending long-term solitary confinement.Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture said, "For people of faith, the widespread practice of prolonged solitary confinement in our nation's prisons and jails is a moral outrage. It is unconscionable that, on any given day, more than 80,000 incarcerated people, including adults and youth, are held in conditions of isolation that we know to be torture. People of color, the poor, and individuals with mental illness bear the brunt of this cruelty. To deny people meaningful human interaction, through solitary confinement, is to violate their very humanity, and debase the divine spark in each of us. To release people directly from solitary confinement into our communities is not only a public safety concern, but betrays our moral commitment to justice that is truly restorative and transformative. For people of faith, it is imperative that the Obama Administration ensure that the nationwide review of solitary confinement create a road map for the elimination of this torture."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat###President Barack ObamaThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President,As representatives of civil and human rights organizations, religious organizations, faith-based and community leaders, and mental health professionals, we applaud your recent historic remarks recognizing that solitary confinement does nothing to rehabilitate those who are incarcerated. We also welcome your announcement that the U.S. Attorney General will conduct a national review of the practice in prisons and jails across the United States. We are writing to urge that this review result in recommendations that create a clear pathway toward the elimination of the use of long-term and indefinite isolation in the United States.Following two Congressional hearings on solitary confinement, a highly critical report on the federal Bureau of Prison's (BOP) use of solitary confinement by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in May 2013; and an independent audit of BOP's use of solitary confinement released in February 2015, it is abundantly clear that solitary confinement is overused and abused across the country. In fact, the audit of BOP's practices found that more than 10,000 people were subject to solitary confinement in federal prisons on any given day in 2013. In some of these units, terms of solitary confinement average nearly four years. In light of these findings, the expert auditors recommended that the agency take immediate steps, including:Stopping the practice of placing persons with serious mental illness in solitary;Stopping the practice of placing vulnerable prisoners in solitary "for their own protection";Stopping the practice of releasing prisoners directly back to the community from solitary confinement units without any re-entry services; andLimiting the mandatory amount of time prisoners are held in solitary confinement.Despite the urgency of the audit's findings, to date, BOP has not made public any plans for implementation of its recommendations. It is imperative they do so without delay.Nationwide, on any given day, more than 80,000 people, including children and persons with mental illness, are held in conditions of solitary confinement in state and federal prisons for month, years, even decades, with many more facing conditions of extreme isolation in jails, detention centers, and juvenile justice facilities throughout the United States. Thousands are released directly from solitary back into our communities profoundly damaged.Neuroscience, ethics and international human rights law widely consider solitary confinement a form of torture. Indeed decades of research demonstrate the harms of solitary confinement on human beings. Its systematic and widespread use in our criminal justice system compromises our stated commitments to human rights, human dignity, the human potential for redemption, and public safety.States and jurisdictions across the country are implementing policy changes that focus on alternatives to solitary confinement. Some have abolished the practice for persons under the age of 18, pregnant women, and for persons with mental illness. Several states are also considering legislative proposals that embrace the recommendations of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, which include prohibiting placement in solitary confinement beyond 15 consecutive days. Supporting and incentivizing such reforms across the country and in the BOP should be an explicit goal of the Attorney General's study of solitary confinement.For the well-being of the men and women incarcerated in federal prisons, the communities to which they will return, and the staff employed by federal facilities, we urge you to ensure the implementation of the BOP auditors' recommendations without delay. We further urge you to ensure a national review that prioritizes humane alternatives to prolonged solitary confinement, including mental health treatment, rehabilitation, and a clear path to the elimination of long-term isolation. Such a review should be completed with enough time for your administration to be able implement its recommendations.The torture of prolonged solitary confinement compromises public safety, increases recidivism, is immoral and indeed has no place in any civilized society. Now is the time to act to ensure it has no place in our own.Sincerely,American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)African American Ministers in Action (AAMIA)African American Ministers Leadership Council (AAMLC)African Methodist Episcopal Minister's Coalition for Redemption and JusticeAlaska Innocence ProjectAmerican Friends Service CommitteeAmerican Humanist AssociationArizona Center for Disability LawArizona Innocence ProjectArizona Justice ProjectBend the Arc Jewish ActionBrookline PeaceWorksBrooklyn Defender ServicesCalifornia Families Against Solitary ConfinementCalifornia Innocence ProjectCalifornia Prison FocusCampaign for Youth JusticeCenter for Public RepresentationCenter for Race, Religion, and Economic DemocracyChicago Committee to Defend the Bill of RightsChildren's Defense FundChildren's Defense Fund - OhioChildren's Law Center, Inc.Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States and CanadaChurch of the Brethren, Office of Public WitnessCitizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE) –InternationalCitizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE) –VirginiaCitizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE) – NevadaCommunity Legal Aid Society, IncConnecticut Innocence ProjectCouncil of Bishops, United Methodist ChurchCriminal Justice Policy CoalitionDeaf Community Action Network (DeafCAN!)Disability Rights IowaDisability Rights MaineDisability Rights WashingtonEcumenical Ministries of OregonEnd Mass Incarceration Together (EMIT), a Unitarian Universalist Mass Action working group (Massachusetts)Family Unity Network of Imprisoned PeopleFlorida Council of ChurchesFlorida Institutional Legal Services ProjectFlorida Justice InstituteFortune SocietyFranciscan Action NetworkFriends Committee on National LegislationGlobal Justice InstituteHip Hop CaucusHuman Rights FirstHuman Rights WatchI.S.P.
