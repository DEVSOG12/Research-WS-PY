Ron Stief, Executive Director at the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released the following statement:"We are disappointed that the U.S. Senate would confirm a lawyer who wrote key legal memos authorizing torture. Torture was against the law then and now, and the brutality that Mr. Steven Bradbury defended violated an act of Congress, the Detainee Treatment Act, that was passed specifically to put an end to the torture program. Multiple https://www.viagrageneriquefr24.com/viagra-en-gel/ Senators took to the floor to describe Mr. Bradbury's unethical record of defending torture, and the vote to confirm him despite that record demonstrates what is wrong with a Senate that rubber-stamps almost anyone for high level positions in government."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
