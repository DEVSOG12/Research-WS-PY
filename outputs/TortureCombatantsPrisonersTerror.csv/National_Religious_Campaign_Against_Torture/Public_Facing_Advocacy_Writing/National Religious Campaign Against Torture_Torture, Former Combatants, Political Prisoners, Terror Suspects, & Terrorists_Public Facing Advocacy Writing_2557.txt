Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released the following statement today in response to NATO’s decision:“As people of faith, we are deeply concerned to hear reports of torture and other abuses occurring in Afghan prisons, and we are relieved to see NATO take this important step to prevent further torture.  We are grateful to the United States and to other NATO member states for their participation in this wise decision.  For the U.S. in particular, this decision stands in bold contrast to decisions of the past.  Previously, the U.S. was known to transfer prisoners to other countries to be tortured.  Now, the U.S., as part of NATO, is actively suspending the transfer of prisoners to jails where there are credible allegations of torture.“However, while this step is important, we must not forget the largerpicture.  Just as allegations of torture in Afghan prisons must beinvestigated, so must the U.S. investigate its own past participation ininflicting torture.  President Obama acted to end torture but has notcalled for a comprehensive investigation into U.S. use of torture.  Agreat nation does not hide from the truth.  Our country must establishan independent, non-partisan Commission of Inquiry to investigate thepast and make recommendations to prevent torture in the future.///HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
