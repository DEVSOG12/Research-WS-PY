Members include representatives from the Baha’i, Buddhist, Catholic, evangelical Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox Christian, mainline Protestant, Quaker, Sikh and Unitarian Universalist communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and congregations.MISSION STATEMENTThe National Religious Campaign Against Torture mobilizes people of faith to end torture in U.S. policy, practice and culture.GOALS1. Ensure that U.S.-sponsored torture of detainees never happens again. 2. End the use of torture in U.S. prisons and detention facilities, in particular the use of prolonged solitary confinement. 3. Promote U.S. policies that enable other countries to end their torture practices and advocate for an end of U.S. support (direct or indirect) of any country that engages in torture. 4. End the bigotry and hatred that promotes the practice and acceptance of torture against religiously, ethnically, and other targeted groups.  WHAT WE BELIEVE The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT), a coalition of religious organizations grounded in the core values of our diverse religious traditions and sharing a deep compassion for all humanity, believes that:All persons, whether friends, strangers, or enemies, possess a basic human dignity and inherent rights to the support of community and the protection of law and therefore should in no instances be subjected to the threat or practice of torture Torture in any form is an illegal and criminal action and its use degrades humanity and wounds the soul of all involved, including the tortured, torturers, those who approve of torture's use and those that stand by in silence. Any nation or society that uses and tolerates the use of torture is diminished; its collective moral authority and voice for justice are eroded. Torture, like any injustice, present in our world, is a threat to all persons. It is imperative for our nation, through its government and citizens, (1) to eschew the use of torture in any and all of our policies… international, military, security and penal and (2) to work to remove torture anywhere it is currently condoned. Abolition of torture will make possible greater bonds of security, community and human flourishing. Through faith put into action in collaboration with others of good will, A WORLD FREE OF TORTURE IS POSSIBLE.HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
