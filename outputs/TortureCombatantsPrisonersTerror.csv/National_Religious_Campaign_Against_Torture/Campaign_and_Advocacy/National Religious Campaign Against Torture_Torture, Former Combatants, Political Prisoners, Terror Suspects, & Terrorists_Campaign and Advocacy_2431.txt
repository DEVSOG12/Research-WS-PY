The HALT Solitary Confinement Act was signed into law in New York, thanks to persistance of advocates with the New York Campaign for Alternaties to Isolated Confinement. Other victories in 2021 included passage of egislation abolishing solitary for youth in Arkansas and for pregnant people in Kentucky. In 2020, 26 states introduced 63 pieces of legislation to limit solitary. Six states (Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia) passed legislation to abolish solitary for youth and pregnant people.NEW JESEY: On July 11, 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law the first fully comprehensive legislation limiting the use of solitary confinement enacted by a state legislature. The Isolated Confinement Restriction Act (A314/S3261) passed the Senate in a 26-3 vote and the Assembly in a 49-24 vote with 5 abstentions."To live in prolonged solitary confinement is to be denied your basic humanity, and to experience such extreme loneliness that it can feel as if the world has forgotten you. Today, because of Gov. Murphy's signature, those who have ever been in solitary, and those who are held in isolated confinement now, know they are not forgotten. Survivors of solitary know that because of their collective efforts, New Jersey will no longer maintain the status quo of their suffering." ~ Justice Rountree, an organizer with NJ-CAIC and a survivor of prolonged solitary confinement in New JerseyEducating People of FaithA first step towards mobilizing people of faith to participate in a state campaign is to educate them about the severe harm caused by solitary confinement.
