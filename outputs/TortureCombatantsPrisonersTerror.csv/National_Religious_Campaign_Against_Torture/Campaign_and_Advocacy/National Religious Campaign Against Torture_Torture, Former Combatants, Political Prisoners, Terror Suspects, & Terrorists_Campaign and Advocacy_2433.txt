The letter called on Gov. Brown to honor the reasonable five core demands in order to bring the hunger strike to a swift and humane end. The clergy signatures from all over the U.S. were delivered to Gov. Brown and Jeffrey Beard of the CDCR.In a statement, the California Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, “We stand opposed to this treatment because it is not restorative. Placing humans in isolation in a Secure Housing Unit (SHU) has no restorative or rehabilitative purpose. International human rights standards consider more than 15 days in isolation to be torture. The world is watching California and the United States.”On August 23, responding to the hunger strike in California prisons, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan Méndez said it was "not acceptable to use threats of forced feeding or other types of physical or psychological coercion against individuals who have opted for the extreme recourse of a hunger strike."
