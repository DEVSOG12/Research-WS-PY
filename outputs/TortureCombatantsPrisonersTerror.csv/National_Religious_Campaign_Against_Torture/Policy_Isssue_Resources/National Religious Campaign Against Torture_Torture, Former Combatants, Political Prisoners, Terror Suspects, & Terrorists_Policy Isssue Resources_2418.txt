As he uncovers the truth – that torture was not only brutal and immoral, but also ineffective – the CIA works to prevent his findings from ever being made public. The Report is political drama about the CIA torture program and the attempt to cover up both the program and its failures. Patriotic in the best sense of the word, it shows how a small number of morally committed people can uncover the truth and achieve change – even when opposed by powerful institutions. Read more about the film and resources for education in your community.To learn more about the Torture Report (the 6,000 page report detailing the CIA's brutal and ineffective torture program that the film title refers to) check out this two-page fact sheet.Appendix MAfter the declassified summary of the Torture Report was made public, Senators John McCain and Dianne Feinstein led a bipartisan coalition of Senators to pass a law mandating that all CIA interrogations adhere to the guidelines in the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. The same law also provides the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees. While not perfect these standards have prevented the CIA from resuming its torture program.Leahy LawNRCAT also works to encourage the U.S. to use its power to encourage other countries to end their use of torture. One means of achieving this is through the Leahy Law.HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
