They arrived in armored cars, carrying weapons, and arrested about 46 people – the last remaining protestors from an 11-month demonstration against the North Dakota Access Pipeline and its planned route under the Missouri River, which nearby Sioux communities worry will threaten sacred sites and pollute their water.Click to expand ImageA Native American man leads a protest march with veterans and activists outside the Oceti Sakowin camp at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S., December 5, 2016.© 2016 ReutersMedia and activists tweeting about their last few days in camp called it #StandingRocksLastStand.But the Standing Rock movement, which maintains that the US government failed to consult adequately with tribal authorities before greenlighting the project, continues. This Friday in Washington, DC, members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, indigenous environmental activists, and allies will march to demand respect for indigenous rights, including their cultural rights and right to water, which for many indigenous peoples have a spiritual significance that bestows a responsibility to protect.Last week the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples wrapped up her official visit to the United States, where she met with tribal communities and leaders across the country, including at Standing Rock. She found that the current US regulatory regime has failed to properly consult with tribal governments on energy projects, not only at Standing Rock but elsewhere. She also highlighted “the criminalization of indigenous peoples asserting their right to protest.”It’s worth noting that the same afternoon officers cleared the camp, North Dakota governor Doug Burman signed into law three bills that will seriously impact future protests: they expanded criminal trespass laws, scaled up criminal penalties for rioting, and criminalized wearing masks and hoods while violating the law (though nearly everyone covers their faces and heads outdoors during the long and frigid Dakota winter). Republican lawmakers have introduced bills supposedly aimed at curbing violence or protecting public safety during protests in at least sixteen other states, making it clear that threats to the rights of one group can quickly spread to others. The bills are at best a solution in search of a problem, and at worst a very pointed attempt to curb and punish public protest.Oceti Sakowin may have closed, but Standing Rock’s next stand deserves our support. The fight to protect indigenous rights — and all peoples’ right to peaceful protest — doesn’t end in North Dakota.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicOil, Mining, and Natural ResourcesMore ReadingApril 6, 2022CommentaryThe US Must Pivot to Renewable Energy and End its Reliance on Petro AutocratsOctober 15, 2019LetterSubmission to Environmental Protection Agency Regarding Proposed Changes to Coal Combustion Residuals RuleReportsDecember 10, 2018ReportThe Coal Mine Next DoorHow the US Government’s Deregulation of Mountaintop Removal Threatens Public HealthJanuary 1, 1999ReportThe Enron CorporationCorporate Complicity in Human Rights ViolationsMore ReadingApril 6, 2022CommentaryThe US Must Pivot to Renewable Energy and End its Reliance on Petro AutocratsOctober 15, 2019LetterSubmission to Environmental Protection Agency Regarding Proposed Changes to Coal Combustion Residuals RuleMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
