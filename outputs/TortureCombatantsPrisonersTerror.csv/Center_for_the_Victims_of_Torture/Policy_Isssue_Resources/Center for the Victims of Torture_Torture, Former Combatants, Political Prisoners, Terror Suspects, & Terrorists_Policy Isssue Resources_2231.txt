Our ongoing interactions with clients through mental health, physical therapy and social work services in Jordan also inform the findings.The report also recommends steps for local and international actors to bolster support for the humanitarian situation in Jordan—including ensuring that survivors in need have access to specialized trauma rehabilitation services, increased resettlement and taking steps to better integrate survivors into transitional justice process.Download the full report here.
