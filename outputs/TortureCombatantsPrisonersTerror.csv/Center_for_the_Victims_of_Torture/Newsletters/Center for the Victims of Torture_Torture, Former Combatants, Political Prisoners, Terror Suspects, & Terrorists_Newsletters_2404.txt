When Dr. Andrea Northwood,
CVT’s director of client services, looks at her calendar
and sees “Joshua” is scheduled fora counseling appointment, she prepares a little differently. That’sbecause Joshua is not only a torturesurvivor, but also a preschooler.“When Joshua is coming in, I gather the toys we use during ourplay therapy sessions and get outcrayons and paper,” said Andrea, alicensed psychologist.
While the majority of clients
CVT sees are adults, children likeJoshua can also be survivors of horrific events. In the U.S. and in all of our international projects wehave served child and youth 
survivors, adapting techniques to their developmental levels.
“I believe young people are much
more vulnerable to the effects oftorture,” said Andrea. “There isnothing more terrifying than thatwhich you don’t understand, andchildren don’t have the same cogni-tive abilities or emotional copingskills as adults. They often can’torganize what happened duringtraumatic events into a coherentstory.”
Events that occur during a “sensi-
tive period” in child developmentcan have very significant long-termeffects. These vulnerable times continue through adolescence.
“Some of the most traumatizedpeople I’ve seen in my 15 years atCVT were adolescents when thetorture occurred,” said Andrea.
When a child is tortured, it
affects the entire family. “Theshame and the guilt of not beingable to prevent a child from beingtortured strikes at the heart of theparent’s most important job—protecting their child from harm,”explained Andrea. Sometimes otherfamily members are dealing withtheir own torture experiences. InJoshua’s family, his mother was savagely raped during war in theirhome country in Africa. As thefamily fled for safety, they werecaptured and abused by governmentauthorities. 
Very young children like Joshua
don’t always experience post-traumatic stress disorder like adults,but they display nervous behaviors,difficulties with developmentalmilestones, anxiety, fears, anger anddifficulty separating from caregivers.Young torture survivors also have amuch harder time regulating their

This fall we closed our project in Sierra Leone. One of CVT’s first 
international initiatives, our work in Sierra Leone was in response to a brutal civil war that included widespread mutilations and dismemberment. 
We helped 6,400 torture survivors reclaim their lives. More than 
19,000 community members participated in awareness-building projects. We helped organize an indigenous mental health organization to carry on the work. And we trained over 100 Sierra Leoneans as mental health counselors.
Psychotherapist David Allan Harris trained many local counselors. He recounted this story:
“I remain in awe of the counselors I supervised, especially considering what they
themselves had suffered … They told me later of living in a community completelyterrorized, where machine gun-toting combatants would push wheelbarrows piledwith the body parts of dismembered corpses down village paths…”
“Like everyone else in the area, this counseling team lived through these unspeakable
horrors—not for a few hours, but for years. Even so, every one of them made it tothe job each day. Most of the time, despite all odds, they worked tirelessly to helppeople navigate the torment of their memories—honoring their pain, that all might in time move forward, once again restored to meaning, to dignity, and hope.” 
You can read David’s story and others on CVT’s Facebook page.   Our work in Sierra Leone began, as do all of our international projects, with an assessment
conducted by our professional staff. These assessments cost $15,000 and are paid for by individualdonors who make gifts of unrestricted support.
As the end of 2010 approaches, I hope you will make a gift of unrestricted support. The funds
we receive at the end of the year dictate the scope of our work and our impact in the coming year.Please give as generously as you are able.
Thank you for your compassion and your partnership. 
Together, we are rebuilding lives and restoring hope.
Sincerely,
Douglas A. Johnson
CVT’s work in Sierra Leone was funded by the United States Department of 
State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and made possible through the financial support of USAID and the American people’s support.Douglas A. Johnson
In 10 years in Sierra Leone, CVT established 
a legacy of healing. These counselors thatCVT hired and trained are building a local mental health organization to continue caring for torture survivors.

Northwood,Director of Client Servicesemotions, which often leads them
to feel out of control and can esca-late their distress and behaviorproblems. 
“The most powerful intervention
we have is with the parents,” saidAndrea, who incorporates them intoher work with a child. One of thebest predictors of a child’s responseto a traumatic event is the parent’sresponse. When parents are fright-ened or distracted by their own suffering, the child picks up on thosefeelings. But if they can provide acalm, loving environment then children can recover from traumaticexperiences more quickly. 
Caring for children and youth
requires special techniques. Coun-selors who work with young childrentypically use play therapy. As achild plays with blocks, dolls, orother toys, the counselor watchesfor themes such as separation andreunion, re-enactments of traumaticevents, dangerous situations andrescue. These themes reveal how achild is coping and processing theirexperiences and allow the counselorto work with the child. With olderchildren and teens, activities suchas drawing and drama allow themto process their experience.
Working with Children Overseas
In our international projects,
local counselors lead large groupsocial activities for children andadults. The activities for childreninclude sports, games, music or storytelling. If a counselor notices achild who looks overly sad or with-drawn, the counselor will provideinformation about CVT’s individualand group counseling services.
The counseling groups for youth
3From page 1typically include drawing as part 
of the therapy. “In Sierra Leone, thechildren would lie on the floor ofthe healing huts as the counselorsled therapy sessions involvingdrawing,” said Linda Nielsen,international clinical consultant.“Drawing, then talking about thedrawing with the group provides a way for young people to expresstheir feelings of fear, grief andanger. It’s often easier for them toshare their experiences throughboth pictures and words.”
In our Jordan project, counselors
are seeing high numbers of youngpeople. Since January 2009, over200 children under 18 years of agehave received care from CVT. Toheal these youngest survivors, wehave developed several counselinggroups, the youngest for six- toeight-year-olds. “It was a challengingtask to make a group for childrenbetween six and eight years,” saidFatima Jarrar, a local counselor inAmman. “My colleague Maysa andI looked for bridges to bind us withthe children and that they could use to express themselves.”
“For one session, we used puppets
to help us capture the children’sHealing the Youngest Survivors
attention,” explained Fatima. “The puppets also made it easier to address difficult topics.” In a ses-sion about loss, the counselors useda teddy bear in a story about war.The bear survived the war but lostsome animal friends just as many ofthe children in the group had lostloved ones in war. In another ses-sion, the children made clay ani-mals and talked about how theiranimals manage anger, sadness orfear. Through the project, the chil-dren learned about coping withfeelings and events. 
The Amman staff leads counseling
groups for older children andteenagers, as well as for mothersand babies, and fathers with youngchildren. 
“It’s amazing how the children
are willing to express themselves ifwe propose ways they can connectwith us. They say a lot, and we haveto listen well to find what they wantto tell us by their way of playing,drawing or acting,” said Fatima. 
With your support, we’ll continue
caring for children and youth. Byworking with parents and children,we rebuild family relationships andrestore hope for the future for theyoungest torture survivors.
Drawing provides a way for young 
torture survivors to express themselvesand is frequently a part of counselingin both individual and group formats.

Last summer, Corbin assisted CVT
on several projects, including translatingdocuments used in French-speakingcountries, primarily the DemocraticRepublic of Congo. 
CVT’s Congolese staff was desperate
for French versions of our media policy,financial reports, grant applications,legal documents and organizationalmaterials. “As I read through the various
documents, I was surprised andencouraged to find that in every areaof work, CVT’s focus is on restoringdignity and control to torture survivors,” Corbin said. 
For example, when translating 
the media policy, he was struck by the care taken to ensure clients inter-viewed by journalists are given fullcontrol. The scope, duration, andlocation of the interview are meticu-lously planned, so the client’s wishesare always respected.
