I was in the military service in Eritrea and planned to get an education after I served. However, the military had a problem with me and they beat me. They tortured me. My head was badly damaged, and I was severely beaten on my back. I had a lot of pain in my legs and was unable to work because of the torture.I escaped to Ethiopia. When I got to the refugee camp, I was living a life of closed doors. I was isolated, always by myself. People noticed this, and they told me about CVT.I got hope at my first session at CVT Ethiopia. I got to talk about what had happened and about my feelings. The experts there were very polite, even when I was crying.CVT gave me a permanent medicine. Doctors can give you tablets to get rid of some problems. But at CVT, it is more. I have overcome the challenges.Today, I see that tomorrow is another day. I watch for others in the camp who are living behind closed doors or who think that CVT is for the “insane.” Now I reach out to them, I speak LOUDLY and tell them – Get to CVT.*Name and some details have been changed for safety and to protect confidentiality.CVT’s work with Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia is funded by a grant from the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
