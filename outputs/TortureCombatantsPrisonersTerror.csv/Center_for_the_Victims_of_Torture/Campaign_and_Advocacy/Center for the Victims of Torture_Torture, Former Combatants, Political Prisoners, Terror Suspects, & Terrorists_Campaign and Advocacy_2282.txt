In only four years, approximately one-fifth of the country’s population died from execution, disease, starvation and overwork.Today, survivors still suffer, and the country continues to endure extreme violence, including sex trafficking, torture in prison, rape and domestic violence.Through the Trauma Healing Initiative—Cambodia, we partnered with the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) of Cambodia to increase resources for survivors and their families and to build a network of torture and trauma rehabilitation services throughout the country. This initiative built a formal network of health and mental health providers which is now able to expand and improve their services to survivors.Some of our accomplishments include:The creation of a network of private and government health and social service organizations that provide care for torture and traumatic violence survivors.In depth trauma-focused mental health training for a core group of health, mental health and social services providers to improve the quality of counseling services for survivors. This group was enlisted to strengthen a larger network of resources for torture and trauma survivors in Cambodia.Development of training tools in Khmer and English for Cambodia’s health and human services professionals. The tools will help professionals recognize trauma symptoms and provide sensitive and effective healing services. Using an electronic format, the tools can be reproduced at little or no cost using USB drives.THI-Cambodia was made possible with the support of the McKnight Foundation, the U.S. Institute for Peace and the United States Agency for International Development and the American people’s support.Main menuWho We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsCampaign to Ban TortureHealing in PartnershipGuineaThe Democratic Republic of CongoInternational Capacity Building ProjectLiberiaMinnesota Training ProjectsSierra LeoneTrauma Healing Initiative AfricaTrauma Healing Initiative - CambodiaWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowRead Ocen James's StoryRead Ocen James's StoryRead Other Survivor StoriesSubscribeSign up for updates and alertsEmail:ZIP/Postal Code:Spam Control Text:Connect with usHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
