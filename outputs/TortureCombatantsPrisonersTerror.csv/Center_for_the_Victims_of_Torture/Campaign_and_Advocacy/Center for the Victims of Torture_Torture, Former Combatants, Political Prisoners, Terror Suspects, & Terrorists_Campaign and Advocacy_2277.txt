Thomas* was diagnosed with several medical conditions as a result of being beaten, dragged, whipped and other torture while he was detained.Thomas applied for asylum, but due to his immigration status he does not qualify for any public benefits and is not authorized to work. Unable to contribute to his host family, Thomas soon found himself homeless. His circumstances and persistent health issues make it challenging for Thomas to meet his basic needs.CVT has connected Thomas to medical care, nutritional food, numerous community resources and volunteer lawyers to assist with his asylum case. Housing has been a persistent issue for Thomas and the primary barrier in his healing journey.Despite this setback, Thomas is a resilient and determined individual. He is grateful for the medical care that CVT made possible and the new connections to his community through church and his English learning center. On the anniversary of his move to the United States, instead of focusing on the reason he fled, Thomas is thankful he found CVT and accessed the care that saved his life. *Name and some details have been changed for safety and to protect confidentiality.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
