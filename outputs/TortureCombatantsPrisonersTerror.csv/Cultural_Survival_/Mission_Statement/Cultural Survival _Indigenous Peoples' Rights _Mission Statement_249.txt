Cultural Survival has curated a robust network of partnerships with Indigenous communities spanning over 70 countries on 6 continents. Our work is predicated on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) where we work to empower Indigenous Peoples as they strive to assert their rights to self-determination and sustain their lands, cultures, and vital ecosystems that are essential to the health of our planet and all living things. Additionally, Cultural Survival supports and directly engages in the global Indigenous Peoples’ movement and has deep connections and influence across movements, sectors, governmental agencies, and international mechanisms like the United Nations, where we have held consultative status with the United Nations Economic Social and Cultural Council since 2005 and hold observer status at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Convention on Biodiversity.Founded in Cambridge, MA, we currently have 33 staff based in 11 countries; our staff is majority women, and both staff and board are majority Indigenous— we are a true reflection of the communities we serve.2067 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02140(617) 441-5400Cultural Survival, Inc. is a non-profit organization with federal 501(c)(3) status.
