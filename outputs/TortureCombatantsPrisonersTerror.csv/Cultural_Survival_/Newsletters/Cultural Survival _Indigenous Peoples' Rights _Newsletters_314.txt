I was a full time commercial fisherman when the Exxon Valdez tanker hit Bligh Reef and spewed tens of millions of gallons of crude oil into the waters and onto the pristine beaches of my ancestral homeland in Alaska’s Prince William Sound. Since then, I have referred to that day as “The Day the Water Died.” It wasn’t just the waters that were impacted. Everything was forever changed for the Eyak people—from our way of life as fishermen to our dreams for the future.Indigenomics: Harnessing the Power of Our CommunitiesHadih, Dene Za Tsekey Za.

We build power through maintaining and passing on our songs, stories, and languages; through prayer, healing, and speaking truth. We build power through defending our lands, waters, and communities through grassroots direct action and international human rights work. And we build power through visioning and creating economic models and practices that reflect our teachings and values and honor our relationships.Building a Business Rooted in Indigenous Values: Tanka BarDawn Sherman (Lakota, Shawnee, and Delaware Tribes) is the CEO of Native American Natural Foods LLC, home to the Tanka brand, a B-corp minority certified owned and minority-led company.

The last 10 years have been troubling for citizens far and wide, as both residential and commercial properties are often without power. The country’s main supplier of electricity, ESKOM, often reports that the infrastructure is aging and has to shut down portions of the grid. The load on the infrastructure has become unsustainable, based in part on population growth.For the Indigenous Economy, the Forest Is LifeOur early ancestors left behind a far-reaching worldview and an idea of diversity to live in coexistence with nature. This worldview impels each Indigenous person to internalize traditions, customs, culture, and language of the community and also to preserve, broaden, and enrich the same. By doing so, we not only ensure self-reliance and sustained development of the community, but more importantly, we take the responsibility to impart that worldview to the larger community and future generations.44-4 Indigenomics: Harnessing the Power of Our CommunitiesDecember 2020Read on IssuuBuy a copySubscribeDepartmentsWomen the World Must HearMOGUL: Reclaiming Heritage Through Indigenous EnterpriseIndigenous KnowledgeIndigenizing Philanthropy: Rematriating the Distribution of WealthStaff SpotlightDaisee Francour (Onʌyoteˀa·ká), Director of Strategic Partnerships and CommunicationsBazaar ArtistBerber Art Market: Keeping Our Culture Alive for Future GenerationsRights in ActionA Lenca Voice of Resistance Against a Culture of Extractivism: Donatila Girón CalixExecutive Director's MessageHarnessing the Power of Our CommunitiesIndigenous ArtsGrounded in Tradition, Guided by Ancestors: Indigenous Business in Uncertain TimesIndigenous ArtsPaʻa ke kahua, Hākaʻi ʻia na kūpunaGrant Partner SpotlightExchange on Our Terms: Cxhab Wala Kiwe Implements Own Currency2067 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02140(617) 441-5400Cultural Survival, Inc. is a non-profit organization with federal 501(c)(3) status.
