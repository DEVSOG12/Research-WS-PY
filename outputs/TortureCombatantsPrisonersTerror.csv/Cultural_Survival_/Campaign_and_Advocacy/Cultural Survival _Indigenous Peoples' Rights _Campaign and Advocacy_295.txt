There have been multiple arrests and approx. 200 of their sheep and goats have been confiscated. For over 40 years they have resisted federal relocation policies and the overreach of corporations like Peabody Coal from exploiting their sovereign land for extraction.Black Mesa Indigenous Support has issued a solidarity call to action to stop these attacks. Click to LIKE their page and TAKE ACTION below.The sheep are more than just livestock to the Dineh elders. "The sheep sustain the vitality of the people and the land, and traditional grazing practices need to be supported not severed. Impoundments are nothing less than harassment and human rights violations."READ more here: http://www.indigenousaction.org/statement-on-recent-aggressive-confiscation-of-dineh-resisters-sheep-herds-by-nabahe-katenay-keedihiihii/TAKE ACTION!“Call the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Hopi Rangers, and the Department of Interior.

They really affect the elderly. Ever since I was a baby I was carried on a horse to herd sheep. I have herded all my life and I am in my eighties. You have the livestock in your heart, and they want to take that away.”--Jack Woody, Black Mesa Elder 10/25/14Related ArticlesIndigenous Peoples Day 2022: A Call to Higher ConsciousnessOct 10, 2022KOEF Grant Partner Spotlight: Eastern Woodlands Rematriation CollectiveApr 28, 2020Letter to the Editor of Dig BostonMar 11, 20202067 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02140(617) 441-5400Cultural Survival, Inc. is a non-profit organization with federal 501(c)(3) status.
