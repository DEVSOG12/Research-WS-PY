Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
A letter from our new executive director: Galina Angarova
Dear Cultural Survival Community,
Sain Baina, Hundete Nuheduut! In my native language, this means, “Greetings, be well dear friends.” 
My name is Galina Angarova, and I come from the Buryat Peoples of Russia. We are an Indigenous 
Peoples who have lived in Siberia for millennia on both sides of Lake Baikal. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Suzanne Benally (Santa Clara Tewa and Navajo), who led Cultural Survival for the past eight years and who stepped down on June 1, 2019, to attend to her family. 
I am deeply humbled and grateful to the Cultural Survival board and staff for appointing me as 
executive director, a position I stepped into on October 1, 2019. I fully understand the amount of work it takes to further raise the visibility of Indigenous Peoples and to elevate their voices and their solutions to climate change, resource management, nutrition, health, education, and other critical issues on the global scale. While I have taken the wheel, I will rely on support both within the organization and our allies in the field: Indigenous-led organizations, NGOs, foundations, donors, and like-minded individuals. It is people like you, and your support, who make our work possible.
We live in a time of crisis. The Amazon rainforest is burning, the Taiga in Siberia is burning, and ice 
caps in the Arctic are melting. Indigenous Peoples are at the forefront of climate change and hold the knowledge that can address and mitigate some of today’s greatest challenges. Cultural Survival is in a unique position to address these urgent issues, having 48 years of experience in the field amplifying Indigenous voices by supporting community media efforts, grassroots advocacy, and development projects that are led by Indigenous people and rooted in Indigenous knowledge.
Together, we can build a future where Indigenous Peoples lead the way towards a sustainable and 
prosperous existence by supporting humanity through applying Indigenous traditional knowledge in many areas of human life: forest management, land management, agricultural practices, sustainable water use, traditional architecture and design, traditional medicine, and creation of networks within and among communities, to name a few. Indigenous Peoples live in some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet and have developed unique strategies to cope with extreme and changing environments. These are proven methods that have worked for millennia and hold the answers to our most looming threat—climate change.
We have launched the new Leadership Transition Fund to fuel our momentum, build on our 
successes, and guide the organization to new work to address the realities of an ever changing world. I invite you to join me as I start this journey as Cultural Survival’s new executive director by supporting our work. Together, let’s ensure the success and longevity of Cultural Survival in supporting our Indigenous partners around the globe. I look forward to our partnership in implementing the rights of Indigenous Peoples enshrined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
In Solidarity and Gratitude,Galina Angarova (Buryat)

AdvocacySupporting grassroots Indigenous partners 
as they work to implement the rights of their communities.
Cultural Survival supports grassroots Indigenous partners as they work to implement the rights of their communities.
Our Advocacy Program brings international attention to places where governments and 
corporations have violated Indigenous rights. Cultural Survival supports Indigenous Peoples around the globe by amplifying grassroots movements to bring awareness and international pressure to their struggles while enhancing Indigenous communities’ capacity, always at the invitation of community leaders, to demand and assert their rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We provide expert testimony on Indigenous, human, and environmental rights violations and coordinate Indigenous participation at international bodies like the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP). Our Advocacy team coordinates reports to the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review and other human rights mechanisms. 
Our Advocacy Program also makes small grants via our Keepers of the Earth Fund to 
grassroots Indigenous community organizations and traditional governments to support community development, implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Indigenous values, and Indigenous rights advocacy. We work to increase the use of UN mechanisms by Indigenous Peoples by offering training and partnership opportunities to our grant partners. We support community media programmatic advocacy work to protect Indigenous community radio stations, and we work to ensure the visibility of Indigenous human rights and environmental defenders by responding to urgent requests for assistance from Indigenous Peoples as they arise, when possible.THE PROBLEM:Indigenous communities have the right to participate in decision making thataffects their communities. Many are striving for meaningful participation when development projects threaten their communities and damage their territories, cultures, and ways of life. Indigenous communities whose right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent is being violated by governments, agribusiness, and extractive industries have recourse through raising public awareness, reporting to international bodies, and challenging actions in courts of law.7
Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
PROGRAM IMPORTANCE:
About 80 percent of the world’s remaining 
biodiversity hotspots are found on Indigenous territories.  Indigenous lands also contain most of the world’s remaining old growth forests, mineral stores, and undammed rivers. Extractive companies and governments frequently encroach onto the traditional lands of Indigenous Peoples because no one holds them accountable for their actions. When Indigenous communities face off against corporate giants, they need allies like Cultural Survival on their side. Cultural Survival uses the mechanisms set up by the United Nations and the Organization of American States to pressure governments to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
IN 2019: •We submitted eight stakeholder reports to the Universal Periodic Review(UPR) and UN Treaty Bodies on human rights issues affecting Indigenouscommunities in El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, andthe United States.
•We provided advocacy accompaniment to our three grantee partners fromMexico, Colombia, and Belize, who were participating in the UN PermanentForum on Indigenous Peoples Issues in New York.
•Our staff and grantee partners held five meetings with UN Country Missions toadvocate on issues of importance, including Freedom of Expression in LatinAmerica, Land Rights in Belize, and the murder of Indigenous land defenderSergio Rojas in Costa Rica.
•We documented and demanded justice for the murders of 29 Indigenoushuman rights defenders across Latin America in 2019.

Community MediaPartnering with Indigenous media 
producers to amplify Indigenous voices on issues that matter.
Cultural Survival partners with Indigenous media producers who are amplifying Indigenous voices on issues that matter to their communities. Our Community Media Program provides important grants and support to a network of Indigenous community radio stations around the globe and develops critically needed programming to assure freedom of expression. Radio’s universal and free nature and its ability to reach many remote communities makes it a key medium to reach Indigenous audiences. Indigenous-produced programming strengthens Indigenous Peoples’ capacity to claim their rights. It enables access to essential information and broadcasting in Indigenous languages that ensures widespread understanding and cultural continuity.
Our Community Media Program works on drafting and reforming Indigenous media policies and promotes freedom of 
expression. Our Community Media Grants Project, launched in 2016, provides opportunities for international Indigenous community radio stations to strengthen their broadcast infrastructure and systems while providing training opportunities to their community journalists through a participatory and dynamic grants program. The initiative enhances community efforts to establish and ensure sustainability of Indigenous community-controlled media, with a strong focus on supporting women in community radio. We achieve this by organizing training to improve radio operations through a series of workshops and exchanges, where local volunteers are trained in journalism, broadcasting, interviewing, recording, audio editing, and technical skills. Our women’s empowerment workshops focus on deepening the dialogue on intercultural gender issues, improving locution, script writing with inclusive language, and audio mastering to improve production quality. 
More than 15 years of experience in Central America has enabled Cultural Survival to learn the immediate needs and 
constraints of Indigenous media and has positioned us to respond in meaningful ways. The Community Media Program expanded its reach to all seven countries in Central America by supporting the founding of the first Central American Network of Indigenous Community Radio Stations, which works toward increased social, cultural, and political justice in the region. We also provide fellowships for Indigenous youth who work in community media.THE PROBLEM:Indigenous communities worldwide often do not have alternatives to state andcorporate controlled media. They face resource challenges, including lack of access to existing national communications infrastructure, exclusionary national telecommunication laws, and in some cases, government repression of their efforts to build and sustain community-based radio stations. In today’s internet age, small, community-based radio stations may seem an outmoded means of communication, but for many rural Indigenous people, the low cost of community radio makes it the ideal tool for defending their cultures, lands and natural resources, and their rights in their native languages. Radio is a critical means of dissemination for news, information, and entertainment in remote areas where options for communication and media are limited.9
Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
PROGRAM IMPORTANCE:
Community radio is an essential medium for 
information sharing, language revitalization, and cultural survival in Indigenous communities. For many Indigenous Peoples, the low cost of community radio makes it the ideal tool for defending their cultures, their lands and natural resources, and their rights. Even in very poor communities lacking electricity, many can afford a small battery-powered radio, making radio the medium of choice for remote areas with few other forms of communication or access to news, information, and entertainment.
IN 2019:
•We funded 35 community mediaprojects in 9 countries totaling$210,000.
•We trained more than 80 Indigenouswomen in radio production,journalism, and advocacy.
•Our Indigenous Community MediaYouth Fellowships supported sixgroups of youth in building capacityin media, journalism, and radioproduction.

Indigenous Rights 
Radio Because Knowledge is Power
Indigenous Rights Radio uses the power of community radio to inform Indigenous 
communities of their rights. 
Our Indigenous Rights Radio Program shares the latest information on Indigenous Peoples’ 
rights and how they are being implemented around the world in English, Spanish, and many Indigenous languages. Our programming is designed for broadcast on community radio stations and includes Public Service Announcements, interviews, and documentaries about internationally recognized rights and the strategies communities are using to make those rights a reality.
Our Indigenous Rights Radio Program produces and distributes radio programming that 
supports local dialogue and action in Indigenous communities globally; increases Indigenous Peoples’ understanding of international human rights mechanisms and how they can become involved in policies impacting them; and empowers listeners in the areas of Free, Prior and Informed Consent, climate change, women’s rights, education, cultures, land rights, self-determination, and youth development.THE PROBLEM:Indigenous communities often lack access to critical information on universalrights and other key international policies that directly impact their cultures, their families, their territories, and their futures. As Indigenous people around the world are asserting their rights, there is a clear need for advocacy-related content that helps inform communities about  topics such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, international level policies, and reports. Radio dissemination remains a critical way for Indigenous communities to access information in their languages. As international policy work affecting Indigenous people increases, there is greater need for articulation between the global and the local arenas.

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
PROGRAM IMPORTANCE:
Community radio is the best tool to reach people who may not read or speak the dominant 
language; these radio programs carry on the Indigenous tradition of oral transmission from generation to generation. Indigenous Rights Radio programs bring the voices of the Indigenous Peoples of Australia, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas into dynamic dialogue about the meaning of Indigenous Peoples’ rights, their common struggles, and innovative solutions to the problems they face. Our programs are broadcast in 35 languages and distributed to more than 1,600 Indigenous-run, community radio stations in more than 80 countries. Indigenous radio programs cover topics such as climate change, women’s rights, freedom of expression, cultural preservation, bilingual education, and strategies to combat rights violations and achieve self-determination.
IN 2019:
Our Indigenous Rights Radio Program distributed more than 160 programs to some 1,600 stations in 69 countries on Indigenous rights topics such as the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent, Indigenous women’s rights, food sovereignty, and traditional knowledge protection.

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
Cultural Survival is one of only a handful of foundations, philanthropists, and regranting 
intermediaries who are going against the current and changing the status quo of “charitable 
giving.” Our grantmaking programs are managed by Indigenous staff and fund Indigenous-led projects at the grassroots level that are based on Indigenous values. 
The Keepers of the Earth Fund  is a small grants fund designed to support Indigenous 
Peoples’ advocacy and community development projects. The Keepers of the Earth Fund provides grants that go directly to grassroots Indigenous-led organizations and groups to support their self-designed development projects based on Indigenous values. Of particular interest are projects focused on Free, Prior and Informed Consent, self-governance, the rights of leadership of Indigenous women, economic sovereignty, land rights, environmental and biodiversity protection, Indigenous language and knowledge retention, movement building, equitable distribution of resources, and Indigenous participation in international, national, regional, and local spaces. 
The Community Media Grants Project  provides opportunities for international Indigenous 
community radio stations to strengthen their broadcast infrastructure and systems while providing training opportunities to their community journalists through a participatory and dynamic grants program. This initiative enhances community efforts to establish and ensure sustainability of Indigenous community-controlled media, with the aim of strengthening the impact and influence of community radio stations at the local and regional levels in their work towards the revitalization of Indigenous cultures, languages, histories, philosophies, rights, the protection of ancestral territories and natural resources, and the promotion of women’s leadership.  THE PROBLEM:Much of the field of philanthropy reinforces an unsustainable model of economylike capitalism. Only 20 percent of global funding goes to human rights issues, and of that, only 3 percent goes to Indigenous Peoples. There is a gap in taking a cross-sectional approach in funding and involving Indigenous people in decision making about grantmaking. Grantmaking13

Cultural Survival Bazaars are annual celebrations of Indigenous arts, music, and cultures from 
around the world. 
Our Bazaar Program aims to strengthen Indigenous cultures by providing a venue for the sale 
of art and crafts made by Indigenous artisans from around the world. The sale of these crafts upholds the artistic traditions that are culturally significant to many Indigenous communities; provides critical capital to Indigenous communities; and provides sustainable income to individual artisans and their families. Our Bazaar Program supports Indigenous Peoples in their participation in economic development strategies as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Through the Bazaars, we support Indigenous Peoples in sharing and maintaining tradition and culture through craft, while ensuring they preserve control of their intellectual property.  We recruit Indigenous vendors and artists, as well as non-Indigenous vendors whose business models respect and prioritize the well being and sustainable livelihoods of the Indigenous artists from whom they source. THE PROBLEM:For Indigenous artists and artisans, creating traditional art is an importantcontinuation of their cultural and family heritage, as well as a vital source of income. Sales opportunities and access to markets is often a challenge for many artists.Cultural Survival

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
PROGRAM IMPORTANCE:
Since 1975, Cultural Survival Bazaars have provided a market for 
thousands of Indigenous artists and cooperatives spanning more than 60 countries and 6 continents. The Bazaars are a series of cultural festivals that provide Indigenous artists, cooperatives, and their representatives from around the world the chance to sell their work directly to the public. Each event features traditional and contemporary crafts, artwork, clothing, jewelry, home goods, and accessories from dozens of countries. In addition, the Bazaars offer cultural performances and presentations, including live music, storytelling, craft-making demonstrations, and the unique chance to talk directly with makers and community advocates.
IN 2019:
•The Cultural Survival Bazaars hosted 68artists and vendors representing more than4,500 Indigenous artists from more than30 countries, and generated $493,358 forIndigenous artists and communities.

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
Since 1975, Cultural Survival has published the award-winning Cultural Survival Quarterly 
magazine to amplify the voices of Indigenous Peoples, shed a light on human rights violations 
of Indigneous communities, and share Indigenous solutions and wisdom about solving today’s greatest challenges. Cultural Survival promotes Indigenous voices to amplify their messages to the world. Nearly all authors and contributors to the magazine are Indigenous, and we place a special emphasis on featuring Indigenous women’s voices. We share stories of current events about Indigenous arts, women’s and youth leadership, food sovereignty, traditional knowledge, language revitalization, climate change mitigation, land management, biodiversity conservation, and best practices about how Indigenous communities are claiming their rights using international human rights mechanisms. We regularly feature Indigenous Arts, Women the World Must Hear, Two-Spirits the World Must Hear, Indigenous Knowledge, Indigenous Food, Indigenous Languages, Climate Change, Rights in Action, Grant Partner Spotlights, Board and Staff Spotlights, Bazaar Artists. THE PROBLEM:Representation Matters. Mainstream media is silent on topics related to IndigenousPeoples, and when it does cover Indigenous issues, Indigenous Peoples are often presented in stereotypical and sensationalistic ways. Indigenous voices need to be heard and heeded. Cultural Survival

From Our Partners: 
Radio came to me, like corn to this world, to fill me with life.  Cultural Survival gave me the 
gift of a beautiful opportunity to recognize the power of my voice, my words. It helped me 
understand that my dream for a community and a country where women do not need to cry in silence is possible; that my words, my voice, are a tool for hope and strength for many other women. I also learned that not only is my work important, but also, I am important! This process has planted in me many seeds: a desire to learn technical skills, admiration for other women and their stories, the fight for our shared pain, and a desire to work on radio production, interviews, and the radio content that is lacking, [as well as] a love of myself, my people, the radio station, and my dreams. Thank you to Cultural Survival for this process and this opportunity. ”  -- Mariana Cecilia García Sánchez (Nahua), a community doctor from San Miguel Tzincapan, Mexico, and women’s workshop participant. 
Cultural Survival arrived at Radio Tsinaka to revive and maintain the passion for [community] 
radio. Thanks to Cultural Survival’s support, the Tsinaka radio team has grown. We have rethought our objectives, such as raising our reach, improving the quality of the programs, and strengthening the organization of the collective. ” --  Radio Tsinaka, Puebla, Mexico

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
It is difficult to get funding to make our own productions in our Indigenous languages. With grants from 
Keepers of the Earth Fund and Community Media, we are recovering our traditional knowledge in our 
own languages, which promotes development in our communities. We have increased the quality and content of our radio productions, and with solar panels we reduced use of electricity by half, allowing us to broadcast longer. ”  -- Oswaldo Martínez, Radio Bue Xhidza, Oaxaca, Mexico
With the support provided, Radio Ak’ Kutan continues to carry our vision to build empowered and unified Indigenous communities with strong cultural heritage and identity.  We are very thankful and appreciative for this support granted to us.  We hope to see more of this help provided to others who are very much in need of this support. ”  -- Ak’ Kutan 96.1 FM “The 
Voice of the Indigenous People.”With the support of Cultural Survival, we significantly strengthened the communication dynamics in the Indigenous communities, motivated the participation of young people, men and women of the territory, and contributed to reaffirming ancestral knowledge and spiritual communication through the formation in the Tulpas with the orientation of the spiritually savvy and knowledgeable and participation in the rituals. The importance of communication as a political and strategic tool for visibility, reporting, training, and raising awareness for mobilization was reaffirmed. ” -- Tejido We’jxia Kaa’senxi del cabildo de Corinto en el Cauca, Colombia

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
Community Media Youth Fellows
Cultural Survival has given me wings to think about advocacy for my people. Participating in 
the UN Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues showed me how far I can go with my dreams. Thanks to the fellowship for giving me the opportunity to work with our elders, and with youth and children. It has been rewarding to share our work with Wayuu people. It is very gratifying to see youth making a significant change that is very helpful to our culture to strengthen our identity.During the development of the project, the most special thing was to be in the field as part of the investigation process, listening to the elders, sitting for hours to hear their stories and hopeful hearts who continue to cling and not forget our customs. I have [also] developed skills in editing and learned many things that I could apply. ”  -- Ronald Epieyu (Wayuu), 2019 Fellow from Utay Stereo, Colombia 
In journalism, one always learns. My experience with the 
fellowship is that it helped me become more fluent in my language. It was an impactful experience to produce radio content in Miskitu. The program will not end with the end of the project but will continue forward. ” -- Jeyson Adonis Miranda (Miskito), 2019 Fellow from Radio Yapti Tasba, Nicaragua

Cultural Survival / 2019 Annual Report
We want to thank Cultural Survival because we learned about journalism and 
community media. Twelve youth received training in tools management in computers, 
which we greatly appreciate. We Kankuamos are in the process of recovering our mother tongue. In our language we only know phrases and short words; we are not fluent. Our goal is to continue creating more programs to reach more people and do more for our people to recover our Kankuamo language and culture. ” -- Kankuamo Youth Commission from Radio Stereo Tayrona, Colombia
Since I was a child, I wanted to make 
movies and videos because when my father migrated to the United States he sent me a camera. With that, I started recording documentaries. That continues to be my dream, but now I want to show the struggles of my village and show our culture. Through audiovisual tools, we can give and learn who we are, how our people have formed, our territory, our language. That is the idea for which I want to be known. The support we have received from Cultural Survival has opened doors for us, where we ́ve learned to speak through audiovisual media. It is a collective achievement of our dreams. ” -- José Samuel López Pérez (Ixil) from Q’Ajsab’ Yol Tenam organization, GuatemalaThere are not many women who decide 
to participate in communication or join an organization strictly for being a woman, perhaps because they feel weak or unsafe, and do not have the incentive to say to themselves that they can. I was able to participate in two diploma workshops for Indigenous women and learned the individual and collective rights of Indigenous women. I was able to be a voice on the community radio ACODIM Nan Pix and replicate my experience on individual and collective rights of Indigenous women. I developed a radio program on this topic so that listeners will know more about Indigenous women’s rights and to honor the women who have lost their way, in honor of the women who have lost their lives for change”. -- Martha Gomez Ortiz (Maya Mam) ACODIM Nan Pix, Guatemala
From this project we managed to understand elders of the community and get them to 
express their needs and feelings that sometimes out of fear they cannot do. It helped us to become aware that as Indigenous youth we are both losing and adopting new cultures without realizing that our culture is unique. We must recover it and be proud of where we come from. ” --Jessica Sarango Rumipulla (Kichwa), Radio Kimsakocha, Ecuador
