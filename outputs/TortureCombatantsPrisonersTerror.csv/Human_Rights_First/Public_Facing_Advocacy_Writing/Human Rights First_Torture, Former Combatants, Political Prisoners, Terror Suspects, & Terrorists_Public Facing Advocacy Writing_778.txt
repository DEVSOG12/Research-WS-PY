Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed.”In the two decades since its opening, almost all of the nearly 800 men who have passed through the prison have been held without charge or trial, and many of the detainees were subjected to torture. Guantanamo costs $540 million per year – more than $13 million per detainee for the 39 men who remain. Thirteen of those detainees have already been cleared for transfer.Bipartisan calls for closing Guantanamo have ranged from President Bush to President Obama. Among the former government officials who support closure are five Secretaries of Defense, eight Secretaries of State, six national Security Advisors, five Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and dozens of retired generals and admirals.President Biden and officials in his administration have been among those who agree it is past time to close the prison. On the campaign trail, then-candidate Biden stated that the prison “undermines American national security by fueling terrorist recruitment and is at odds with our values as a country.”Once Biden took office, Press Secretary Jen Psaki made clear that the administration’s “goal” and “intention” is to close the prison by the end of President Biden’s administration, and Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “believes Guantánamo Bay should be closed. He fully supports the administration’s desire to do that, and he fully expects to be a partner in the inter-agency process and discussion as that moves forward.”Despite these helpful statements, President Biden has made disappointingly little progress towards closing the prison during his first year in office. The administration has transferred only one detainee, cleared for transfer since 2016. While there is no perfect solution, the Biden administration can close the prison, even without the help of Congress, and should act swiftly to do so.Closing the prison would not only end the unconscionable, counterproductive morass at Guantanamo that has gone on two decades too long, but it would also signify that the United States is trying to turn the page on a dark chapter in its history in which it too often ignored the rule of law and respect for human rights in the name of national security and counterterrorism.PressPublished on January 11, 2022ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsAuthoritarianism-Accountability20 Years After 9/11: Rights-Based Policies for a New EraTestimonyAuthoritarianism-Accountability“A life in safety would not mean anything if my children were not here with me”: Joys and Trauma Persist for Refugees Separated from Their FamiliesEach weekday Josefina* prepares breakfast for her son, helps him begin his school day of remote learning, and greets her babysitter before heading off for…LetterAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityA Year After George Floyd’s Murder, Human Rights First Continues Work to Demilitarize Law EnforcementNEW YORK – The murder of George Floyd a year ago was not a unique event, but it was a catalyst for some qualified progress…PressAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityA Year After War’s End EOA Assists Afghans Seeking SafetyNEW YORK — A year after the end of the war in Afghanistan, Evacuate Our Allies (EOA) continues to work for the safety and security…PressAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityAdministration Urged to Condemn Attacks on Protesters in BahrainWashington, D.C. — Human Rights First today called on the Trump Administration to condemn the actions of Bahraini security forces who reportedly attacked peaceful protesters…PressAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityAir Raid App Offers Reassurance in UkraineLetterAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityAmy Coney Barrett’s Troubling Record on Asylum and ImmigrationThe Senate Judiciary hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett featured extensive exchanges on abortion rights, health care, and a few other hot-button issues.…LetterAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityAs Afghanistan Troop Withdrawal Begins, Allies Shouldn’t Be Left BehindWASHINGTON — As the United States begins the troop withdrawal from the nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan, national security experts, human rights advocates and U.S.…PressAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityBahrain Stages Fake Elections For Poodle ParliamentWe know from Roman historian Suetonius that Julius Caesar’s reforms included a political system where half the magistrates were popularly elected and half were appointed.…LetterAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityBahrain Travel Bans Reveal InsecurityFirst, Bahraini authorities hit human rights defender Nabeel Rajab with charges for writing an oped in the New York Times, and now they have charged…LetterAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityBallymurphy Families Win Decades-Long Fight For Official TruthNews last week that a Belfast coroner had officially declared "entirely innocent" ten local people shot dead in 1971 was a vindication of the campaign…Amicus Briefs, Blueprints, Fact Sheets, Lab Project, Lawsuit, Letter, Opinions, Press, Reports, Statements, Story, Talking Points, Testimony, Updates, VFAI Leader Spotlights, Volunteer ResourcesAuthoritarianism-AccountabilityBiden Administration Should Move to End a Decade of Pain in BahrainExactly ten years ago today I was sitting in a Bahraini royal palace witnessing an extraordinary event.
