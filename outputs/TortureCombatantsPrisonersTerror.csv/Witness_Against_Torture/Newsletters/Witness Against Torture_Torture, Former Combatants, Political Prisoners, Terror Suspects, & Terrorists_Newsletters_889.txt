We celebrate the good news but continue to work towards a day when places like Guantanamo no longer exist. First, The Periodic Review Board has cleared Fayiz Al Kandari for release. Secondly, two more men have been sent “home.” Younous Chekkouri is now detained in Morrocco and has been allowed to meet with his family. Abdul Rahman Shalabi has been released to Saudi Arabia. Finally, During the Pope’s visit to the United States, it was announced that Shaker Aamer will finally be released to the UK. We join his family and legal team in asking for his immediate release. Please continue to share these stories and keep those released in your thoughts and prayers. May their transition to freedom and their journey of recovery be full of connection and support.
