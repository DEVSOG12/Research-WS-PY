Many lack access to medical care, social services, and employment assistance.  Furthermore, additional challenges such as language and cultural barriers often further hinder their ability to work. One third have no legal status in the countries to which they were exiled. They cannot travel to other countries, whether to visit their families, seek appropriate medical care or find employment.The US government should provide reparations to all the men whom it has tortured and detained unjustly.  Some former detainees, such as Omar Kahdr, have received compensation from their own governments, but none have received a penny or an apology from the US.  But we, the grass roots, and perhaps the conscience of our country, will follow in the footsteps of Dan Norland, who mounted a campaign to raise money so that Lakhdar Boumediene could buy a car to earn his living.Donate to Guantanamo Survivors Fund!Donate HereDonate to support our workPlease consider a donation to help fund our annual Fast for Justice this January.  We are completely volunteer-driven and run.

They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2022 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
