SPANISH JUDGE HEARS TESTIMONY FROM EXPERT WITNESSES  IN THE 
GUATEMALA GENOCIDE CASE  
 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE OF MASS MURDER, ARMY DOCUMENTS, A ND FILMED 
INTERVIEWS WITH ALLEGED PERPETRATORS WILL BE INTROD UCED  
 
Madrid, Spain, December 2, 2009  – On December 1, 2009, Judge Santiago Pedraz heard  
extraordinary testimony from Fredy Peccerelli, Dire ctor of the Forensic Anthropology 
Foundation of Guatemala (FAFG), on hundreds of exhu mations conducted across 
Guatemala to unearth the remains of civilian victim s killed in Guatemala during in the 
1980s.  Peccerelli, who was brought into the case a s an expert witness by the Center for 
Justice & Accountability (CJA) and the Spanish Asso ciation for Human Rights 
(APDHE), presented the Judge with a 900-page report  analyzing 363 exhumations 
conducted by FAFG of victims killed between 1978 an d 1984 in five municipalities in 
Guatemala. Among the conclusions of the report, FAF G found that of the 1,884 victims 
exhumed, more than 25 percent were infants or child ren; 78 percent exhibited gunshot 
wounds to the head; and 65 percent of victims were killed in 1982 alone.  
 
Peccerelli’s testimony supported the accounts of do zens of witnesses and survivors who 
have previously testified. Almudena Bernabeu, CJA’s  International Attorney and lead 
counsel in the genocide case states: “This week’s t estimony will serve to corroborate 
evidence already brought before this Court.  Having  in the case the objective and tangible 
information provided by original military documents  and the anthropological data takes 
the case to the next level.” 
 
Also testifying was the National Security Archive’s  Kate Doyle, who has obtained 
hundreds of pages of original Guatemalan Army recor ds on “Operation Sofía,” an alleged 
"scorched earth operation" which targeted Mayan com munities in the Quiché region 
during July and August, 1982.  Although survivors o f Operation Sofía have already 
described the effects of the Army’s attack in testi mony before Judge Pedraz – including 
the killing of unarmed men, women and children, the  burning of houses, destruction of 
crops, slaughter of animals, and indiscriminate bom bing of civilians fleeing the violence 
– this will be the first time original Guatemalan m ilitary records about a specific  2 of 2 
 
operation have ever been made available to prosecut ors in a human rights case.  Doyle 
explained the evidence contained in the documents f rom Operation Sofia on the role of 
the Army High Command in ordering, planning and ove rseeing the operation. 
 
Finally, Pamela Yates, documentary film director an d co-founder of Skylight Pictures, 
provided testimony about her experience filming in Guatemala during the height of 
repression in the first half of 1982. She provided eye witness testimony of military 
combat missions into the Mayan regions of the count ry, interviews with Gen. Benedicto 
Lucas García and Ríos Montt, and footage of a massa cre site in Chajul, Quiché in May 
1982. As supporting documentation, Yates brought he r 1983 documentary film, When the 
Mountains Tremble , as well as seven hours of footage not included in  the film and 
transcripts from the interviews she conducted with the defendants and other military 
officers.  
 
The Guatemala Genocide Case began in 1999 when Nobe l laureate Rigoberta Menchú 
Tum and other victims filed a criminal complaint in  Spain against senior Guatemalan 
government officials charging them with terrorism, genocide and systematic torture.  CJA 
has led the work on the case since 2006 as a privat e prosecutor for Mayan survivors of 
the genocide with the support of APDHE. The case is  modeled on the Pinochet case 
which was also brought in Spain. Naomi Roht-Arriaza , Professor at Hastings College of 
the Law in San Francisco, and Susie Kemp of the Net herlands are also part of the 
international legal team.  
 
CJA is a San Francisco-based human rights organizat ion dedicated to ending torture and 
other severe human rights abuses around the world a nd advancing the rights of survivors 
to seek truth, justice and redress. CJA pursues lit igation in the U.S. and Spain to hold 
perpetrators individually accountable for human rig hts abuses, develop human rights law, 
and advance the rule of law in countries transition ing from periods of abuse.  
 
APDHE, founded clandestinely in 1976 soon after the  death of dictator Francisco Franco, 
is the oldest human rights association in Spain. AP DHE advocates among government 
agencies and civil society for the protection of hu man rights. APDHE has a long tradition 
of working for the promotion of human rights in Lat in America.
