On August 14, 1985, the Peruvian army murdered 69 unarmed indigenous Quechua villagers, including many young children. CJA has played a central role in trying to hold accountable two of the ringleaders of the massacre.CJA’s clients, Teófila Ochoa Lizarbe and Cirila Pulido Baldeón, were just 12 and 13 years old when soldiers, dressed in fatigues and carrying machine guns, came to Accomarca. Teófila and Cirila were able to find hiding spots, and witness the violent events unfold.From their hiding spots, Teófila and Cirila saw the soldiers rounding up the villagers, beating the men and raping the women and girls. Teófila and Cirila watched as the soldiers corralled the villagers into two buildings, open fire with their guns and toss grenades. The girls’ family members—their mothers and siblings—were among the 69 murdered.At the time, Peru’s army was fighting Maoist guerrillas belonging to the Shining Path movement. The villagers, like many indigenous communities, were caught in the middle of the struggle between rebel forces and the government.Two decades after the massacre, Teófila and Cirila worked with CJA to bring the massacre’s ringleaders, Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado and Lieutenant Juan Rivera Rondón, to justice. Both men had retired in comfort to the United States. That is, until CJA exposed them.In 2007, CJA filed two civil suits in federal court, one against Rondon in Maryland and the other against Hurtado in Florida.The federal court in Florida entered a default judgment against Hurtado for torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, awarding $37 million to the plaintiffs. The judgment was the first time that anyone had been held accountable for committing atrocities during the Accomarca Massacre.A year later, in 2008, the United States deported Rondon back to Peru. In 2011, Hurtado was extradited, marking the first time the US authorities honored an extradition request for torture and genocide.For the next five years, criminal proceedings wound their way through a Peruvian court in Lima.Finally, on September 1, 2016, the court found our defendants and five others guilty grave human rights violations, sentencing Hurtado and Rondon to 24 and 23 years in jail, respectively.  The landmark Accomarca Massacre conviction is the culmination of nearly a decade of advocacy by CJA on two continents.Legal Actions & Related ProjectsClientsPerpetratorsPressPartnersRelated ResourcesCenter for Justice and Accountability268 Bush St #3432San Francisco, CA 94104T: 415 544 0444F: 415 544 0456FacebookTwitterYouTubeLinkedInFlickrSnapchatAbout UsAnnual ReportsFinancesPrivacy PolicyContact UsBecome a SupporterDonateJustice CircleWays to GiveEventsResourcesCJA In The NewsNewslettersLegal GlossaryArchivesSign Up For Updates From CJACopyright © 2022Photo creditsXSign up for updatesEmail*First Name* Last Name* Country*AfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarrussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Democratic Republic of theCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen IslandsSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweCAPTCHAΔX×We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
